&lt;h2 id="managing-ggus-account-data">Managing GGUS account data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GGUS users should be able to manage their GGUS account data by themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Information about registration and account management is collected on
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">GGUS registration page&lt;/a> and could be
reached by clicking the &amp;ldquo;Registration&amp;rdquo; link on top of
&lt;a href="http://ggus.org/">GGUS home page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For managing the GGUS account data the user has to click the link “Check your
GGUS account” at the bottom of this page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updating-the-personal-certificate-information">Updating the personal certificate information&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Users should update their certificate information before their old certificate
expires. They can navigate to the
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">registration page&lt;/a>, click the link &amp;ldquo;Check
your GGUS account&amp;rdquo; and update their data. Modifying the DN field will result in
an additional DN field: the old DN will be kept and the new DN will be added.
Subsequently, the user is identified with the two DNs. If the old DN is no more
valid please just clear the DN field and save the change. Once the old
certificate has expired before updating the account data, users can request an
update via GGUS ticket against Helpdesk(GGUS) support unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="linking-the-egi-sso-persistent-id-to-the-ggus-account">Linking the EGI SSO persistent ID to the GGUS account&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pre-requisites: the email address of your EGI SSO account must be equal to the
email address registered in GGUS!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For adding your EGI SSO persistent ID to your account data please do the
following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>login to GGUS using your EGI SSO account&lt;/li>
&lt;li>on GGUS home click the &lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">Registration&lt;/a>
link&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_EGI_AAI_1.png" alt="your account information">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>click the button &amp;ldquo;Add my Shibboleth ID to my account&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of the
yellow box.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-supporter-privileges">Getting supporter privileges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to process tickets assigned to the support unit you belong to, or in
general tickets submitted by other users and assigned to other support units,
you need to own supporter privileges. Therefore users need to register an
account at GGUS. Registration can be done either using an X509 personal
certificate or using the EGI AAI account.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="registration-with-an-x509-certificate">Registration with an x509 certificate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For registering with an X509 certificate the user should go to
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=index">GGUS home&lt;/a> and click the
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">registration link&lt;/a> in the menu bar at the
left. This link opens the registration information page which gives some
additional information about registration process. Clicking on the
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">registration link&lt;/a> guides to the form that
the user has to fill in. After filling in the registration form, GGUS team will
check whether support privileges can be granted. The user will receive an email
from the GGUS team (usually) confirming their supporter privileges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="registration-with-the-egi-aai-account">Registration with the EGI AAI account&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Users who do not have a valid X509 certificate can access GGUS via
&lt;a href="../../../users/check-in">EGI Check-in&lt;/a>. For getting support privileges the user
needs to be member of the
&lt;a href="https://aai.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:69">ggus-supporters&lt;/a> group
in EGI Check-in. However the user should fill in the
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">registration form&lt;/a> for creating an account
at GGUS. Support privileges will be granted automatically. The user will receive
an automated email from GGUS system confirming their support privileges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Registration_Form.png" alt="GGUS registration form">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both authentication methods, X509 certificate and EGI Check-in account, will be
guaranteed in the future. Since the use of login and password will no longer be
guaranteed in the future, it is recommended to access GGUS with a valid digital
certificate or EGI Check-in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="im-member-of-ggus-supportersegieu-group-why-dont-i-have-support-privileges-in-ggus">I&amp;rsquo;m member of ggus-supporters.egi.eu group. Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have support privileges in GGUS?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pre-requisites: the email address of your EGI SSO account must be equal to the
email address registered in GGUS!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Case 1: user isn&amp;rsquo;t registered in GGUS yet.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Unregistered users have to register first. On
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info">registration page&lt;/a> you will see this text:
“You are member of EGI AAI CheckIn ggus supporter. You will get automatically
support right for the GGUS portal once you will submit this form.“ Support
permissions will be granted automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Account_Update_PersistentID.png" alt="Updating PersistentID">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click on the &amp;ldquo;Add my &amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Case 2: user already registered in GGUS with an X509 DN.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can decide to add the Shibboleth ID to the existing account and check the
updated account. In case the email addresses are different you may either
harmonize your email address in EGI SSO and GGUS account or create a new account
using EGI SSO data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-in-touch-wit-the-ggus-team">Getting in touch wit the GGUS team?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The preferred way to get in contact with the GGUS team is by submitting a GGUS
ticket against Helpdesk (GGUS) support unit.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GGUS is the Helpdesk service of the EGI Infrastructure. Incident and Service
request tickets can be recorded, and their progress is tracked until the
solution. The users of the service should not need to know any of the details of
what happens to the ticket in order to get it from creation to solution.
However, an understanding of the operation of the system may be helpful to
explaining what happens when you request help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tickets can be created through the GGUS &lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/">web interface&lt;/a>, which
is described in section &amp;ldquo;Accessing the web interface to GGUS&amp;rdquo; of this note.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the ticket has entered GGUS, it is processed by assigning it to the
appropriate group to deal with the issue. The groups are generally addressed via
mailing lists, and so GGUS assigns the ticket to a group, and an email message
is sent to people on the appropriate list. Sometimes, a ticket is simple and it
is assigned to the correct group immediately and dealt with immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="submitting-a-ticket-using-the-web-interface">Submitting a ticket using the web interface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before using this route, it is essential to have either a digital certificate
installed in the appropriate manner in the web browser or an EGI Check-in
account.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="accessing-the-web-interface-to-ggus">Accessing the web interface to GGUS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If the user carries out all of the steps above, but is not registered to use
GGUS, then the home page is like the one shown in the following figure:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="UG_Unregistered_User.png" alt="GGUS home page for unregistered users">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the user faces problems with their certificate, they may get help at
&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/USG_Getting_Certificate">wiki.egi.eu: Getting certificate&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For accessing GGUS users have to register first. Registration process is
described in chapter Registering at GGUS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="registering-at-ggus">Registering at GGUS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For getting supporter privileges users need to be registered. For registering at
GGUS the user should go to &lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=index">GGUS home&lt;/a> and
click the &lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=register_info">registration link&lt;/a>.
This link opens the registration form that the user has to fill in. In addition,
there are some links where the user can find information about X09 personal
certificates. Users who do not have a valid digital certificate can access GGUS
via EGI SSO. After filling in the registration form, the user receives an e-mail
from the GGUS team with his access data to GGUS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="accessing-ggus-with-certificate">Accessing GGUS with certificate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The primary address of the GGUS portal is: &lt;a href="http://ggus.eu">http://ggus.eu&lt;/a>. If
the user enters this in the browser, a warning will be displayed by the browser
prompting the user to specify which certificate to use (if the user has not
selected to automatically select the certificate in the browser settings). The
reason for this warning is that GGUS has to validate the user in order to allow
access. After that, the user will no longer be asked to identify himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The user identifies themselves with their digital certificate. At this point in
time, GGUS has identified the user and displays the start page as shown in the
following figure:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Home.png" alt="GGUS home page for recognized users">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that in this case, the user&amp;rsquo;s identity is displayed on the page and GGUS
has recognized that this user is registered to submit tickets. If authentication
by certificate fails, you will be taken to the login page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="accessing-ggus-via-egi-check-in">Accessing GGUS via EGI Check-in&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When choosing &amp;ldquo;Login via EGI AAI CheckIn&amp;rdquo; on the login page the user is guided
to the EGI Check-in page were the users Identity Provider can be selected. After
authenticating there, the user will be redirected to GGUS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ticket-submit-form-on-web-interface">The ticket submit form on web interface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The tickets submit form offers a set of fields which should help the user to
describe his issue as detailed as possible. Most of the fields on the submit
form are optional. Only field “Subject” is required. The submit form consists of
three main sections: the &lt;strong>user information&lt;/strong>, the &lt;strong>issue information&lt;/strong> and the
&lt;strong>routing information&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Ticket_Submit_Form.png" alt="Ticket submit form on web interface">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>User information&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Most fields in the user information section are pre-filled by GGUS system.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“Name/Login” is taken from the GGUS user database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“E-Mail” is also taken from the GGUS user database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Notification mode” defaults to “on solution”. The “Notification mode” manages
the update notifications the user receives. “On solution” means that the user
only gets notified when the ticket status is set to “solved” or a comment is
added to the public diary. Additional information is available by clicking on
the question mark on the right hand side of the field label.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“CC to” could be filled with any mail address of people who should be informed
about this ticket. Notifications are sent on every ticket update. The field
content could only be changed by people who have support access. Additional
information is available by clicking on the question mark.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Issue information&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Although only one field is mandatory in this section, as much fields as possible
should be filled with information.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“Date/Time of issue” defaults to the submitting time. This field should be set
if the ticket is submitted much later than the issue occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Subject” is a mandatory field. It should give a short description of the
issue. This field is limited to 250 characters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Describe your issue…” is limited to 4000 characters. It should be used for a
detailed description of the issue. If the user does not know which information
to add here he could click on the question mark for getting additional
information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Concerned VO” provides a drop-down list of all VOs supported by GGUS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“VO specific” is a flag indicating whether an issue is VO specific or not. It
defaults to “no”. This flag could only be set to “yes” in combination with a
VO selected in field “Concerned VO”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Affected Site” The site impacted by the issue. A drop-down list with all EGI
sites registered in GOC DB and OSG sites registered in OIM DB is available.
This is no routing information!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Affected ROC/NGI” The NGI/ROC impacted by the issue. A drop-down list of all
NGIs/ROCs integrated in GGUS is provided.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Ticket category” provides a drop-down list with possible values. This field
is for categorizing the issue. It defaults to “Incident”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Type of issue” provides a drop-down list with possible values. This field is
for categorizing the issue. It defaults to “Other”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Priority” provides a drop-down list with possible priority values. They are
“less urgent” which is the default, “urgent”, “very urgent” and “top
priority”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Attach file(s)” offers the possibility to upload 4 attachments (e.g. log
files etc.) at a time. Attachments are limited to 2 MB. Please avoid uploading
file formats “.exe”, “.php”, “.htm(l)”.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Routing Information&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“Notify SITE” provides a drop-down list with all EGI sites registered in GOC
DB and OSG sites registered in OIM DB. If selecting a site from the list this
site will be notified about this ticket by mail. Additionally the ticket is
assigned to the appropriate NGI/ROC directly, bypassing the TPM (Some words
about TPM). If setting a site value the appropriate NGI/ROC is set
automatically. Choosing an NGI/ROC simultaneously is not possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Assign to ROC/NGI” provides a drop-down list of all NGIs/ROCs integrated in
GGUS. Choosing a value in this field assigns the ticket to the appropriate ROC
directly, bypassing the TPM. If assigning a ticket to an NGI/ROC choosing a
site value simultaneously is not possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After clicking the “Submit” button the user gets a confirmation page showing the
information submitted and the ticket ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Confirm_Submit.png" alt="Confirmation after ticket submit">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bypassing-the-tpm">Bypassing the TPM&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The TPM (Ticket Processing Manager) is the 1st Line Support in GGUS. Users can
bypass the TPM if they have good knowledge about where the problem is. For this
purpose at the bottom of ticket submit form there is a section &amp;ldquo;Routing
information&amp;rdquo;. Selecting either a site from the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Notify-Sites">&amp;ldquo;Notify SITE&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> drop-down menu
or a support unit from the &amp;ldquo;Assign to support unit&amp;rdquo; drop-down menu routes the
ticket directly to the selected support unit. If selecting a site name the
NGI/ROC the site belongs to is set automatically. Hence the ticket is assigned
to the relevant NGI/ROC. Additionally the site will receive a notification about
the ticket. Selecting both, the &amp;ldquo;Notify SITE&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Assign to support unit&amp;rdquo;
is not possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tickets of type &lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Team-Tickets">TEAM&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Alarm-Tickets">ALARM&lt;/a> are always routed to
the relevant NGI/ROC by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="browsing-your-own-tickets">Browsing your own tickets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After authenticating themselves the user has access to the GGUS homepage. On
this page they see a list of their own open tickets and a list of the latest
open tickets of all users (Figure 2). Below the list of the user’s own open
tickets there are two links for further browsing possibilities of the user’s own
tickets:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Show my complete ticket list,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My Team Tickets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The system only shows the user tickets which have been created with the same
authentication information the user is currently logged in. This means if a user
submits tickets with different certificates he does not see all of their
tickets. The reason for this is that the DN string of the certificate is stored
in each ticket. Showing all tickets of a user can be done by using the GGUS
search engine. In the GGUS search engine users can search by username amongst
others. This search will show all tickets of a user independent from the
authentication information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="show-my-complete-ticket-list">Show my complete ticket list&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This link opens a new window showing tables of all open and closed tickets of
the user and all tickets of other users the user has subscribed to. Information
on how to subscribe to a ticket is available in section &amp;ldquo;Subscribing to a ticket
of another user.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Complete_Ticket_List.png" alt="Complete ticket list on GGUS home">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modifying-tickets">Modifying tickets&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="modifying-your-tickets-using-the-web">Modifying your tickets using the web&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For modifying a ticket the user can just click on the ticket ID. He is guided to
another page. On this page are three main sections:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the ticket information,&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Ticket_Information.png" alt="Ticket information section">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the ticket history,&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Ticket_History.png" alt="Ticket history">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the modify section.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Modifysection_User.png" alt="Ticket modify section">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ticket information gives an overview of the personal data the user provided,
the issue description and the ticket status. The ticket history shows all
actions that have been taken to solve the ticket, the date and time these
actions have been taken and the name of the supporter who did them. In the
modify section the user can add some additional information or comment on a
question of a supporter to them. The user can add attachments, change the email
notification behavior of the system and change some other attributes of his
ticket.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="escalating-a-ticket">Escalating a ticket&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Between the information section and the ticket history there is a button which
allows the user to escalate a ticket (Figure 9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Escal_Button.png" alt="Escalation button">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three escalation levels are available in GGUS:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Escalating ticket to the support unit it is assigned to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Escalating the ticket to the support unit and the TPM on shift.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Escalating the ticket to the support unit, the TPM and the GGUS ticket
monitoring.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The escalation levels are reached one by one. It is not possible to choose one
of them. Additional information is available by clicking on the little question
mark on the left hand side of the button.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reopen-a-solved-ticket">Reopen a solved ticket&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If a ticket is already closed it could be reopened by adding a comment and
changing the status to “reopened” in the “Modify section” (Figure 8). In this
case the support unit which solved the ticket and the TPM receive an email about
the ticket reopening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="verifying-the-solution">Verifying the solution&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When a ticket is solved, the user could confirm that the solution has solved
their issue by verifying it. A solution could be verified by either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Clicking the “Verify” button in the web portal or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replying to the solution mail without changing anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Verifying a solution can help to increase the quality of solutions in GGUS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Verify_Button.png" alt="Verify button">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="modify-your-tickets-using-email">Modify your tickets using email&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Updating a ticket using email is also possible if one fundamental requirement is
achieved. The mail subject must contain the typical GGUS string “GGUS-Ticket-ID:
#Ticket-ID” where &amp;ldquo;Ticket-ID&amp;rdquo; is the ID of the ticket which should be updated.
The easiest way to do this is to reply to an update notification received from
GGUS. When updating a ticket using email the whole mail body will be added to
the ticket. Changing any other field (e.g. status, priority,…) is impossible&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ticket-participation">Ticket Participation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GGUS system offers various possibilities for participating in tickets. They are&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the CC field,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the Involve others field and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the Subscribe field.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>An overview on these fields is given in the table below. Ticket participation
can be done by adding a valid mail address to one of these fields. Please avoid
adding closed mailing lists as such produce a lot of mail errors! Several mail
addresses have to be separated by semicolon.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>&lt;/th>
&lt;th>User submit&lt;/th>
&lt;th>User modify&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Supporter modify&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>CC&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yes&lt;/td>
&lt;td>No&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Involve others&lt;/td>
&lt;td>No&lt;/td>
&lt;td>No&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Subscribe&lt;/td>
&lt;td>No&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yes&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3 id="the-cc-field">The “CC” field&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The CC field can be set by the user in the ticket submit form. Updates are only
possible for supporters for correcting or removing invalid mail addresses. Every
ticket update triggers a notification email to the mail address specified in the
“CC” field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-involve-others-field">The “Involve others” field&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The “Involve others” field is only for supporters use. Every ticket update
triggers a notification email to the mail address specified in the “Involve
others” field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="subscribing-to-a-ticket-of-another-user">Subscribing to a ticket of another user&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Figure 11: Ticket subscribe Every user could subscribe to tickets of other users
if he is interested in the solution of any. For subscribing a valid email
address has to be provided. The user gets a notification once the ticket is
solved. After subscribing to a ticket the user could change the notification
mode or unsubscribe if he wants to (Figure 11). Accessing the system with the
same credentials as used for subscription is necessary for this. Additional
information on subscribing to tickets is available by clicking on the question
mark at the right hand side of the label “Subscribe to this ticket”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_Subscribe.png" alt="Ticket subscribe">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-gets-what-email-notification-from-ggus">Who gets what email notification from GGUS?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The ticket &amp;ldquo;submitter&amp;rdquo; gets emails according to the &amp;ldquo;Notification mode&amp;rdquo; value
(s)he selected when submitting the ticket. If the selected &amp;ldquo;Notification mode&amp;rdquo;
value is &amp;ldquo;on every change&amp;rdquo; then all updates are sent to the &amp;ldquo;submitter&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Public
Diary&amp;rdquo; entries are sent to the submitter regardless the value of the
&amp;ldquo;Notification mode&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Internal Diary&amp;rdquo; entries never go to the &amp;ldquo;submitter&amp;rdquo;. They
are reserved for exchanges amongst supporters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The email addresses in the &amp;ldquo;Cc:&amp;rdquo; field can be entered by the &amp;ldquo;submitter&amp;rdquo; and
receive the same notifications as the submitter. &amp;ldquo;Public Diary&amp;rdquo; entries are sent
to the addresses in the &amp;ldquo;Cc:&amp;rdquo; field. &amp;ldquo;Internal Diary&amp;rdquo; entries never go to the
people in the &amp;ldquo;Cc:&amp;rdquo; field. They are reserved for exchanges amongst supporters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The email addresses in the &amp;ldquo;Involve others:&amp;rdquo; field can be entered by supporters
only and receive the same notifications as the Support Unit (SU) to which the
ticket is assigned. &amp;ldquo;Internal Diary&amp;rdquo; entries are sent to the relevant SU members
AND the people in the &amp;ldquo;Involve others:&amp;rdquo; field, as they are supposed to be
experts and contribute to the ticket solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The email address in the &amp;ldquo;Assign to one person:&amp;rdquo; field can be entered by
supporters only and receive the same notifications as the Support Unit (SU) to
which the ticket is assigned. &amp;ldquo;Internal Diary&amp;rdquo; entries are sent to the relevant
SU members AND the people in the &amp;ldquo;Involve others:&amp;rdquo; field AND the email address
in the &amp;ldquo;Assign to one person:&amp;rdquo; field as they are, all, supposed to be experts
and contribute to the ticket solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every ticket update triggers an email to the addresses in the &amp;ldquo;Cc:&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Involve
others:&amp;rdquo; and to ticket subscribers, i.e. GGUS users, unrelated to the specific
ticket, who entered their own email in the &amp;ldquo;Subscribe to this ticket&amp;rdquo; field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GGUS email notifications highlight the fields changed with the specific update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please avoid including closed mailing lists, e-groups in these fields as mail
delivery will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="browsing-all-tickets">Browsing all tickets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the bottom of the home page there are additional links for browsing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Search ticket database,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Show all open tickets,&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="ggus-search-engine">GGUS search engine&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For browsing all tickets the GGUS search engine is a useful tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="GGUS_User_Search.png" alt="GGUS search engine">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GGUS search engine can be entered by clicking on link “Search ticket
database”. When accessing the search engine a default search is performed like
shown in Figure 12: GGUS search engine. Searching via Ticket ID is the easiest
and fastest way to look at a ticket. When searching via Ticket ID all other
search parameters were ignored. Besides searching for all open tickets this is
the recommended kind of search, because it avoids needless workload on the
system. When searching via ticket ID the ticket details are shown in the same
window. For getting back to the main page use the &amp;ldquo;Back&amp;rdquo; button of your browser.
The various search parameters can be combined in any way wanted except
“Untouched since”. Description fields “Keyword”, “Involved supporter” and
“Assigned to person” trigger a LIKE search to the database. Concatenating
keywords with “AND” or “OR” is currently not possible. The search can either be
started by clicking on &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; or just hitting the return key. The result of a
search by parameters is shown in the result list. For viewing ticket details
just click on the ID. A new window opens showing ticket details. For getting
back to the search result just close the window with the ticket details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="showing-all-open-tickets">Showing all open tickets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Clicking on this link shows all open tickets that are currently in the system.
Unlike “Showing all open tickets” the default search in GGUS search engine uses
a timeframe of one week for showing open tickets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="contacting-the-ggus-team">Contacting the GGUS team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Users can click on the “Envelope” icon in the menu bar for sending an email to
the GGUS team with any comments. Note: This must not be used for submitting
support requests as it does not create a ticket in the system!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ggus-development-plans">GGUS development plans&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On GGUS home page there are a couple of links where users can get more
information on the
&lt;a href="https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=development">GGUS development plans&lt;/a> as well as
submit own feature requests. Feature requests are collected in the GGUS shopping
lists in JIRA (only for users having a CERN account) and EGI RT.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="operation-of-ggus">Operation of GGUS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The GGUS system is running on servers located at Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology (KIT), Germany. Besides the GGUS production system a backup system is
in place. Switching from production system to backup system currently needs
manual interaction. An automatic switch in case of fail-over will be
implemented. GGUS staffs at Karlsruhe are not providing support apart from
requests concerning GGUS system itself. They can be contacted by email to
support &amp;ldquo;at&amp;rdquo; ggus.org. Usual office hours for GGUS staffs are from 07:00 to
15:00 o’clock (UTC).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tpm">TPM&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>TPM (Ticket Processing Manager) is the most important part of the support system
for the grid. The purpose of TPM is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>closing simple trouble tickets,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ensuring that other tickets are sent to the correct place for processing,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reacting to alarms that tickets have not been processed,&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The TPM teams consist of people with a broad knowledge of the Grid.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ticket-monitoring">Ticket Monitoring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Besides developing and maintaining GGUS system the GGUS team is also doing the
ticket monitoring. The ticket monitoring team is responsible for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Waiting-For-Submitter-Process">reminding users&lt;/a>
in case their input is required for further ticket processing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Waiting-For-PT-Process">reminding supporters&lt;/a>
in case tickets are not processed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>assisting in any problem during ticket processing&lt;/li>
