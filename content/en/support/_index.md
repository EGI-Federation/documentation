Support for EGI services is available through the
[EGI Helpdesk](http://helpdesk.egi.eu/), an internal EGI
[service](../internal/helpdesk).

The EGI Helpdesk is a distributed tool with central coordination, which
provides the information and support needed to troubleshoot product and
service problems. Users can report **incidents**, **bugs** or **request
changes**. The support activities are grouped into first and second level
support.

us at `support` `<at>` `egi.eu`.
