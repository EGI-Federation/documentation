## What is it?

The [EGI Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu) is a central
portal for supporting the operations and coordination of the EGI Infrastructure.
It offers a bundle of different capabilities, such as the broadcast tool, VO
management facilities, a security dashboard and an operations dashboard that is
used to display information about failing monitoring probes and to open tickets
to the affected Resource Centres.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for the Operations Portal
is available in the [EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Operations_Portal).
