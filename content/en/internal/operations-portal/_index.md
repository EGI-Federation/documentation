## What is it?

The [Operation Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/) provides a central
portal for the operations community that offers a bundle of different
capabilities, such as the broadcast tool, VO management facilities, a security
dashboard and an operations dashboard that is used to display information
about failing monitoring probes and to open tickets to the Resource Centres
affected.
