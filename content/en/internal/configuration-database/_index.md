{{% pageinfo %}} This documentation about the Configuration Database is a work
in progress, more documentation is currently available at the
[EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB). {{% /pageinfo %}}

The Grid Configuration Database (also know as the GOCDB) contains general
information about the sites participating to the production infrastructure.

It's used by all the actors (end-users, site managers, NGI mangers, support
teams, VO managers), by other tools and by third party middleware to discover
information about the infrastructure topology.
