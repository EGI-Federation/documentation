## What is it?

The [EGI Configuration Database](https://goc.egi.eu) (GOCDB) is a
**central registry that records topology information about all sites**
participating in the EGI Cloud infrastructure.

The configuration database also provides different rules and grouping
mechanisms for filtering and managing the information associated to resources.
This can include entities such as operations and resource centres, service
endpoints and their downtimes, contact information and roles of staff
responsible for operations at different levels.

The configuration database is used by all the actors (end-users, site managers,
NGI mangers, support teams, VO managers), by other tools, and by third party
middleware to discover information about the infrastructure topology.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for the configuration
database (work in progress) is available in the
[EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB).
