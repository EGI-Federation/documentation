  Topology and configuration registry for sites in EGI infrastructure

## What is it?

The [EGI Configuration Database](https://goc.egi.eu) (GOCDB) is a **central
registry that records topology information about all sites** participating in
the EGI infrastructure.

The configuration database also provides different rules and grouping mechanisms
for filtering and managing the information associated to resources. This can
include entities such as operations and resource centres, service endpoints and
their downtimes, contact information and roles of staff responsible for
operations at different levels.

The configuration database is used by all the actors (end-users, site managers,
NGI managers, support teams, VO managers), by other tools, and by third party
middleware to discover information about the infrastructure topology.

database (work in progress) is available in the
[EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB). {{% /alert %}}
