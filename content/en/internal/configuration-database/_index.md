{{% pageinfo %}} This documentation about the Configuration Database is a work
in progress, more documentation is currently available at
[EGI's wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB). {{% /pageinfo %}}

The EGI Configuration Database (previously known as the GOCDB) contains general
information about the sites participating to the production infrastructure.

It's a central registry to record information about the topology of the EGI
e-Infrastructure. This includes entities such as Operations Centres, Resource
Centres, service endpoints and their downtimes, contact information and roles of
users responsible for operations at different levels.

It's used by all the actors (end-users, site managers, NGI mangers, support
teams, VO managers), by other tools and by third party middleware to discover
information about the infrastructure topology.
