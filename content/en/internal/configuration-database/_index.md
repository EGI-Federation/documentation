## What is it?

The [EGI Configuration Database](https://goc.egi.eu) (previously known as
GOCDB) contains general information about the sites participating in the
production infrastructure.

It is a central registry to record information about the topology of the EGI
e-Infrastructure. This includes entities such as Operations Centres, Resource
Centres, service endpoints together with their downtimes, contact information,
and user roles responsible for operations at various levels.

The configuration database is used by all the actors (end-users, site managers,
NGI mangers, support teams, VO managers), by other tools, and by third party
middleware to discover information about the infrastructure topology.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} The documentation of the configuration
database is a work in progress, more details are available in the
[EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB).
