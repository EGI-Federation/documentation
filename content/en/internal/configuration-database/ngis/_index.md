## Introduction

An NGI forms a grouping of Sites in EGI Configuration Database. The
Configuration Database stores the following information about these groups. The
main page listing groups actually shows NGIs/ROCs, and is available from **"List
of NGIs/ROCs and associated contacts"**, linked from the main menu.

Each NGI has its own listing page, accessible by clicking on the "view" link in
group listing pages. A group details page shows users with a role on that group,
as well as member sites and associated contacts and roles.

## Adding NGIs

Adding groups is not possible through the Input System web interface. If you
want to start the registration process of a new NGI, please follow the procedure
described on:

> [PROC02: Operations Centre creation](https://go.egi.eu/proc02)

Integration of the new group in the EGI Configuration Database is part of the
procedure but has to be done by the Configuration Database admins.

## Editing Groups

To edit a group, simply click on the "edit" link at the top of the group's
details page.

## Deleting Groups

This operation is not allowed.
