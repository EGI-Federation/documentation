  Resource usage accounting for EGI services

## What is it?

EGI Accounting **tracks and reports usage of EGI services**, offering insights
and control over resource consumption. EGI Federation members can use it to
account for the resource usage of their own services.

EGI Accounting consists of two main components:

- The **Accounting Repository** is where all accounting data is collected by a
  network of message brokers that transfer usage data from hosts and services.
- The **[Accounting Portal](https://accounting.egi.eu)** allows filtering and
  displaying resource usage information.
