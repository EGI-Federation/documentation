  Resource usage accounting for EGI services

## What is it?

EGI Accounting tracks usage of resources in the EGI Cloud and provides
estimated charges associated with the recorded resource usage. It can show
reports with line items for each EGI Cloud service, usage type, and operation.
It consists of two main components:

- The **Accounting Repository** is where all accounting data is collected
- The **[Accounting Portal](https://accounting.egi.eu)** allows filtering
  and displaying resource usage information

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for the Accounting
Repository is available in the
[EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Accounting_Repository).
