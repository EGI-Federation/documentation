## What is it?

The ARGO Messaging Service (AMS) is a Publish/Subscribe Service, which implements
the Google PubSub protocol. It provides an HTTP API that enables Users/Systems to
implement message oriented service using the Publish/Subscribe Model over plain
HTTP. AMS is a backend service for EGI operational tools that need to use a
messaging functionality for message communications purposes (i.e. Argo monitoring,
APEL, the Operations Portal, EGI Fedcloud etc.).
