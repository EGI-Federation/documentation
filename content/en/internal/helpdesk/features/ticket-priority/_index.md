## Priority definition

If you plan to adjust the ticket priority of a ticket we kindly ask you to
provide also justification for this change in the reply text box of the ticket.

The following table will help you to find an appropriate priority value:

| Priority     | Comment                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| very urgent  | service interrupted; needs to be addressed as soon as possible |
| urgent       | service degraded; a workaround might or might not be available |
| less urgent  | wishes and enhancements that are "nice to have"                |

In particular, be very economical when choosing 'very urgent'. This value, when
reaching the supporters via another ticketing system interface, might become a
beep or phone alert even in the middle of the night. This level of support is
ONLY committed by WLCG Tier0 and Tier1s and ONLY for ALARM tickets.

Finally, please be aware that the supporter who will try to solve your problem
may change the value you have chosen to a more realistic one, putting their
justification in the ticket.
