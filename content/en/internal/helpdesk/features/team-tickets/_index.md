## Introduction: purpose and conditions

* The purpose of TEAM tickets is to allow all team members to modify all tickets
of their team although they may not have support access and they do not have
submitted the ticket themselves.
* Only members of a few VOs are allowed to submit team tickets:
** Alice
** Atlas
** Cms
** Lhcb
** Biomed
** Belle
* The VO memenbers need to have the appropriate permissions in GGUS user database
* Other VOs can request this functionality by opening a GGUS ticket
* Team tickets are routed to the NGI/ROC the site belongs to automatically. They
do not need a routing by the TPM. The NGI/ROC is notified about the ticket in the
usual way. In parallel, the site receives a notification email.
