### Documentation

In the documentation section there is a collection of links providing useful
information around GGUS system.

### Registration

All information about registration can be found on the
[registration page](https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=register_info). For
registering as support staff, click the link “Apply” and fill in the registration
form. After registering successfully you will receive a confirmation mail from
GGUS team.

If you want to update your account data, you can do this using the link "Check
your GGUS account" on the registration page. If you can’t access GGUS web
interface due to changed DN string of your personal certificate, you can log into
the system using your Check-in account. Then go to the registration page and
click on Check/update your GGUS account. The system shows you all your user data.
It detects the new DN string of your browser automatically. Just save the changes
by clicking on button Update now. Additional information on GGUS accounts is
available here(link to new location of https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/FAQ_GGUS-Account).
