# GGUS account

## Managing GGUS account data

GGUS users should be able to manage their GGUS account data by themselves.

Information about registration and account management is collected on 
[GGUS registration page](https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info) 
and could be reached by clicking the "Registration" link on top of 
[GGUS home page](http://ggus.org/).

For managing the GGUS account data the user has to click the link “Check your GGUS account”
at the bottom of this page.

## Updating the persomal certifcate information

Users should update their certificate information before their old certificate expires.
They can navigate to the [registration page](https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info),
click the link "Check your GGUS account" and update their data. Modifying the DN field will
result in an additional DN field: the old DN will be kept and the new DN will be added.
Subsequently, the user is identified with the two DNs. If the old DN is not valid anymore
please just clear the DN field and save the change. Once the old certificate has expired
before updating the account data, users can request an update via GGUS ticket against
Helpdesk(GGUS) support unit.

## Linking the EGI SSO persistent ID to the GGUS account

**Pre-requisites: the email address of your EGI SSO account must be equal to the email address registered in GGUS!**

For adding your EGI SSO persistent ID to your account data please do the following:

- login to GGUS using your EGI SSO account
- on GGUS home click the [Registration](https://ggus.eu/?mode=register_info) link
