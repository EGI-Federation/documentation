## What is it?

Support for EGI services is available through the

The EGI Helpdesk is a distributed tool with central coordination, which provides
the information and support needed to troubleshoot product and service problems.
Users can **report incidents**, **bugs** or **request changes**.

The support activities are grouped into first and second level support.
