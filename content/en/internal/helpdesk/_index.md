## What is it?

Support for EGI services is available through the
[EGI Helpdesk](http://helpdesk.egi.eu/).

The EGI Helpdesk is a distributed tool with central coordination, which
provides the information and support needed to troubleshoot product and
service problems. Users can **report incidents**, **bugs** or **request
changes**.

The support activities are grouped into first and second level
support.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for the EGI Helpdesk is
available in the [EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS).
