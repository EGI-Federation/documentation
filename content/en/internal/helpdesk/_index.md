The [EGI Helpdesk](http://helpdesk.egi.eu/) provides the information and support needed to
troubleshoot your product and service problems. You can report incidents, bugs
or change requests.

EGI provides support to users and operators through a distributed helpdesk with
central coordination. The helpdesk provides a single interface for support.
The support activities are grouped into first and second level support.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for the EGI Helpdesk is
available in the [EGI Wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS).
