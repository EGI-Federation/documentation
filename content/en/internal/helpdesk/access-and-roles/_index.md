## Access the EGI Helpdesk service

Users can access the [EGI Helpdesk service GGUS](https://helpdesk.egi.eu/) 
with an existing institutional/social account through EGI Check-in.

When you access the service for the first time, you are automatically assigned
a role with minimal privileges by default: in such a situation you can only
create user tickets and can't access tickets created by other users.

In order to create your first ticket, please use the green "+" button in the
lower left part of your window.
