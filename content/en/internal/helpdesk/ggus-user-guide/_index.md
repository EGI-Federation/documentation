## Introduction

GGUS is the Helpdesk service of the EGI Infrastructure. Incident and Service request tickets
can be recorded, and their progress is tracked until the solution. The users of the service
should not need to know any of the details of what happens to the ticket in order to get it
from creation to solution. However, an understanding of the operation of the system may be
helpful to explaining what happens when you request help.

Tickets can be created through the GGUS [web interface](https://ggus.eu/), which is described
in section "Accessing the web interface to GGUS" of this note.

Once the ticket has entered GGUS, it is processed by assigning it to the appropriate group to
deal with the issue. The groups are generally addressed via mailing lists, and so GGUS assigns
the ticket to a group, and an e-mail message is sent to people on the appropriate list.
Sometimes, a ticket is simple and it is assigned to the correct group immediately and dealt
with immediately.
