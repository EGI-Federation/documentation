  Monitor performance of EGI services

## What is it?

The [EGI Service Monitoring](http://argo.egi.eu) **keeps an eye on the
performance of the EGI services** to quickly detect and resolve issues.

The service monitors the infrastructure by collecting data generated by
functional probes. The raw data is merged into statistics and available through
the user interface in a user-friendly way. It provides automated reporting tools
with minimal development or operational effort for setting up monitoring.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for Service Monitoring is
available [on the ARGO site](https://argo.egi.eu/egi/documentation).

## Accessing the monitoring information

### Service Monitoring endpoints

Different service instances are available for different purposes:

- [Certified sites](https://argo-mon.egi.eu/nagios/)
- [Uncertified sites](https://argo-mon-uncert.cro-ngi.hr/nagios/)

The uncertified endpoint is using a certificate from a Certificate Authority
(CA) that is part of the
[IGTF distribution](https://dl.igtf.net/distribution/igtf/current/).

If your browser is presenting you a security warning about an unknown CA, you
can manually had the certificate for the ROOT CA to your trust store. The
process is dependant on the Operating System and browser that you use.

#### Adding IGTF CA bundler to system store on macOS

[FetchCRL3](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/FetchCRL3) can be used to maintain the
Certificates Revocation Lists (CRLs), providing up to date information on
revoked certificates.

```shell
# Install fetch-crl to refresh CA's CRLs
brew install fetch-crl
# Preparing a target directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/grid-security/certificates

# Retrieving and extracting the bundle
CA_BUNDLE=https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/accredited/igtf-preinstalled-bundle-classic.tar.gz
curl -s $CA_BUNDLE | sudo tar -xvz -C /etc/grid-security/certificates

# Adding the certificates to the system trust store
for cert in $(ls /etc/grid-security/certificates/*.pem); do
  sudo security add-trusted-cert \
    -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \
    -d $cert
done
```

### Access rules

For an individual site, people having specific roles for the site can access
using the X509 certificate linked to their account in
[Configuration Database](../configuration-database):

- Site Administrator
- Site Operations Manager

For all sites, the members of the
[dteam](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/view/voname/dteam) VO can access.
