## What is it?

The [EGI Service Monitoring](http://argo.egi.eu) **keeps an eye on the
performance of the EGI services** to quickly detect and resolve issues.

The service monitors the infrastructure by collecting data generated by
functional probes. The raw data is merged into statistics and available through
the user interface in a user-friendly way. It provides automated reporting tools
with minimal development or operational effort for setting up monitoring.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for Service Monitoring is
available [on the ARGO site](https://argo.egi.eu/egi/documentation).
