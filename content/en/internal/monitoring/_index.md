## What is it?

The [EGI Service Monitoring](https://argo.egi.eu) **keeps an eye on the
performance of the EGI services** to quickly detect and resolve issues.

The service monitors the infrastructure by collecting data generated by
functional probes. The raw data is merged into statistics and available through
the user interface in a user-friendly way. It provides automated reporting tools
with minimal development or operational effort for setting up monitoring.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Documentation for Service Monitoring is
available
[on the ARGO site](https://argoeu.github.io/argo-monitoring/docs/intro/).

## Accessing the monitoring information

In order to access the information it's required to have an X509 client
certificate provided by an [IGTF](https://www.igtf.net/)-accredited Certificate
Authority.

For people not having access to an IGTF client certificate it's possible to
access Availability and Reliability information on the
[EGI ARGO page](https://argo.egi.eu/).

### Service Monitoring endpoints

Different service instances are available for different purposes:

- [Certified sites](https://argo-mon.egi.eu/nagios/)
- [Uncertified sites](https://argo-mon-uncert.cro-ngi.hr/nagios/)

The endpoint for uncertified sites is using a certificate from a Certificate
Authority (CA) that is part of the
[IGTF distribution](https://dl.igtf.net/distribution/igtf/current/) but that is
not in the default Operating System and browser stores.

> Your browser may be presenting you a security warning about an unknown CA,
> it's a known issue with certificate having IGTF trust but not public trust
> (ie. not by default in the Operating Systems and browsers' trust stores).

If you want to address this you can try to manually download the certificate for
the ROOT CA and add it to your trust store and mark it as trusted. The exact
process is dependant on the Operating System and browser that you use.

### Access rules

For an individual site, people having specific roles for the site can access
using the X509 certificate linked to their account in
[Configuration Database](../configuration-database):

- Site Administrator
- Site Operations Manager

For all sites, the members of the
[dteam](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/view/voname/dteam) VO can access.
