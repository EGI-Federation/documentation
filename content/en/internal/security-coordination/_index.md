## What is it?

Security Coordination improves the capabilities of local security activities for
a safer federated infrastructure environment.

The EGI Computer Security Incident Response Team
([EGI CSIRT](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/CSIRT)) has the tools and
the knowledge to run Security Coordination on behalf of the federation. The EGI
CSIRT is a certified Trusted Introducer since 2015.

Security Coordination is especially important in a federated environment, where
incidents are often not isolated and can affect several service providers. A
coordinated response is essential to minimize the impact of incidents and
vulnerabilities.

This service provides:

- Security tools monitoring the distributed services with a minimum effort
- The expertise of the [EGI CSIRT](https://csirt.egi.eu/)
