## What is it?

Security Coordination improves the capabilities of local security activities for
a safer federated infrastructure environment.

The EGI Computer Security Incident Response Team
([EGI CSIRT](https://csirt.egi.eu)) has the tools and the knowledge to run
Security Coordination on behalf of the federation. The EGI CSIRT is a certified
Trusted Introducer since 2015.

Security Coordination is especially important in a federated environment, where
incidents are often not isolated and can affect several service providers. A
coordinated response is essential to minimize the impact of incidents and
vulnerabilities.

This service provides:

- **Security Operations Coordination** - Central coordination of the security
  activities ensures that policies, operational security, and maintenance are
  compatible amongst all partners, improving availability and lowering access
  barriers for use of the infrastructure.
- **Security Policy Coordination** - The Security Policy Group
  ([SPG](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/SPG)) develops policies
  covering diverse aspects, including operational policies (agreements on
  vulnerability management, intrusion detection and prevention, regulation of
  access, and enforcement), incident response policies (governing the exchange
  of information and expected actions), participant responsibilities (including
  acceptable use policies, identifying users and managing user communities),
  traceability, legal aspects, and the protection of personal data.
- **Software Vulnerability Group Coordination** - The Software Vulnerability
  Group [SVG](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/SVG) aims to eliminate
  existing software vulnerabilities from the deployed infrastructure and prevent
  the introduction of new ones, and runs a process for handling software
  vulnerabilities reported.
- **International Grid Trust Federation (IGTF) and EUGridPMA** - Representation
  of EGI in IGTF and EUGridPMA. A common authentication trust domain is required
  to persistently identify all EGI participants.
- **EGI Computer Security Incident Response Team**
  ([EGI CSIRT](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/CSIRT)) expertise
- **Security Incident Response Coordination** - Coordination of incident
  response activities in collaboration with the Incident Response Task Force
  ([EGI-CSIRT IRTF](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/CSIRT+IRTF)).
- **Security monitoring** - [Monitoring services](./monitoring) to check for
  security vulnerabilities and other security-related problems in the EGI
  production infrastructure.
- **Tools for Security Service Challenge support** - Security challenges are a
  mechanism to check the compliance of sites/NGIs/EGI with security
  requirements. Runs of Security Service Challenges need a set of tools that are
  used during various stages of the runs.
