  Organise data in research projects with openRDM
---

While most other [data management services](..) are available in the EGI infrastructure,
there are specialized services in the EGI portfolio that are offered for in-house
installations by research communities, with support for customization and
configuration from EGI.

## What is it?
The [openRDM](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/openrdm-eu) service,
an open Research Data Management (RDM) tool,
offers **advanced organisation of data during ongoing research projects,
as an integrated environment with data management and digital lab notebook**.

openRDM combines a data management platform with a digital lab notebook and a sample and
protocol management system. It enables scientists to meet the ever-increasing requirements
from funding agencies, journals, and academic institutions to publish data according to the
[FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) data principles – according to which data
should be _Findable_, _Accessible_, _Interoperable_ and _Reusable_.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} The openRDM service is based around the
active research data management (ARDM) platform [openBIS](https://openbis.ch/).
