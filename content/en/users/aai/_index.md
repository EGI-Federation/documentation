## Working with federated resources

[EGI is a federation](https://www.egi.eu/federation/) of
compute and storage resource providers.

In order for the providers to be able to
[contribute their services](../../providers/check-in) to the federation
and to help scientific user communities take advantage of 
compute and storage solutions that could potentially span across multiple
of these providers, a common Authentication and Autorization
Infrastructure (AAI) is needed.
