## Overview

The EGI is a federation of compute and storage resource providers.

In order for the providers to be able to contribute their services and serve
scientific user communities, and to allow those communities to take advantage
of advanced compute and storage solution that could potentially span across
multiple of these providers, a common Authentication and Autorization Infrastructure
(AAI) is needed.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}} The term AAI is sometimes replaced by
Single Sign-On (SSO).
