## Working with federated resources

[EGI is a federation](https://www.egi.eu/egi-federation/) of compute and storage
resource providers.

In order for the providers to be able to
[contribute their services](../../providers/check-in) to the federation and to
help scientific user communities take advantage of compute and storage solutions
that could potentially span across multiple of these providers, a common
Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) is needed.
