## What is it?

[EGI Check-in](https://www.egi.eu/service/check-in/) is a proxy service that
**allows scientific communities to securely access and control access to
resources in the EGI Federated infrastructure**. It operates as a central hub
that connects federated [Identity Providers](../../../providers/check-in/idp) (IdPs)
with EGI service providers.

Users can authenticate with their preferred IdP
(e.g an [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org) account, institutional account,
social media account, etc.) to access and use EGI services in a uniform
and easy way.

The main features of Check-in:

- Enables multiple federated authentication sources using different technologies
- Has an user registration portal that also allows linking accounts
- Increases productivity and security by simplifying user authentication and authorization
- Federated in [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org) as a service provider
- Combines user attributes originating from various authoritative sources
  (IdPs and attribute provider services) and delivers them to EGI service
  providers in a transparent way

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} EGI Check-In is based on
the [AARC Blueprint Architecture](https://aarc-project.eu/architecture/).
