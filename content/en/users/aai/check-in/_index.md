## What is it?

[EGI Check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/) is a web service that
allows scientific communities to securely control access to resources in the
EGI Federated infrastructure. They can use Check-in to control who is authenticated
(signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

The following sections cover how to sign up for and EGI account, and how to
use it to access resources.
