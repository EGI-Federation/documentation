## What is it?

The EGI Secrets Store helps you to **securely encrypt, store, and retrieve
credentials for your services**. Instead of hardcoding credentials in your
applications, you can make calls to Secrets Store to retrieve your credentials
whenever needed.

The Secrets Store helps you protect access to your IT resources and data by
enabling you to rotate and manage access to your secrets.
