## Overview

Cloud security in the EGI Federated Cloud is the highest priority.
Scientists and researchers, who are the main users of the services offered by EGI,
benefit from data centers and network architectures that are built to meet the
requirements of the most security-sensitive institutions and organizations.

The following services that can help you to configure and
consume EGI services while meeting your security and compliance objectives:

  hardcode it in code, configuration files, or environment variables.

See the following sections for more details on these security-related services.
