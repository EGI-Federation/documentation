  Step by step guide to get your first Virtual Machine up and running

## Overview

This tutorial describes how to create your first Virtual Machine in the EGI Federation.

## Step 1: Signing up

Create an EGI account with [Check-In](../../check-in/signup).

## Step 2: Enrolling to a Virtual Organisation

Once your EGI account is ready you need to join a
[Virtual Organisation (VO)](../../check-in/vos/). We have a dedicated VO called
[vo.access.egi.eu](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/view/voname/vo.access.egi.eu)
for piloting purposes. If you are not sure about which VO to enrol to, please request
access to the _vo.access.egi.eu_ VO with your EGI account by visiting the
[enrollment URL](https://aai.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:240).

## Step 3: Creating a VM

Once your membership to a VO has been approved you are ready to create your first
Virtual Machine. There are several ways to achieve this. The simplest way is to
use a web dashboard like [VMOps Dashboard](../../cloud-compute/vmops/) or
[Infrastructure Manager](../../cloud-compute/im/). On the other hand, advanced users
may prefer to use the [command line interface](../../getting-started/cli).

To know more about the [Cloud Compute](https://www.egi.eu/services/cloud-compute/)
Service in EGI please visit its [dedicated section](../../cloud-compute).
