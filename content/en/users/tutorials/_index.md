<i>"EGI Federation - Advanced Computing for Research" (April 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5083/ 
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI federation is the largest distributed computing
infrastructure in the world, and brings together hundreds of data centres
worldwide and also includes the largest community cloud federation in Europe
with tens of cloud providers across most of the European countries offering
IaaS cloud and storage services. The current federated resources represent
altogether more than 350 Petabytes of online storage and 380 Petabytes of archival
storage supported by approximately 1 M Cores. EGI expanded the federation of its
facilities with other non-European digital infrastructures in North America,
South America, Africa-Arabia and the Asia-Pacific region, as such EGI fully
realised the “Open to the World” vision. In order to interoperate at international
level, EGI and its partners operate in the context of a lightweight collaboration
framework defining rules of participations via a corpus of policies and technical guidelines.
<br/><br/>
EGI offering includes a federated IaaS cloud to run compute- or data-intensive
tasks and host online services in virtual machines or docker containers on IT resources
accessible via a uniform interface; high-throughput data analysis to run compute-intensive
tasks for producing and analysing large datasets and store/retrieve research data efficiently
across multiple service providers; federated operations to manage service access and operations
from heterogeneous distributed infrastructures and integrate resources from multiple independent
providers with technologies, processes and expertise offered by EGI; consultancy for user-driven
innovation to assess research computing needs and provide tailored solutions for advanced computing.
<br/><br/>
The notion of a distributed infrastructure offering advanced resources and services for
data-intensive processing in research and innovation has been part of the EGI mission
and vision since the EGI design and implementation that started with the DataGrid project
back in 2000 under the leadership of CERN. Distributed processing of data supported by
a pan-European broadband network infrastructure, solutions for trust and identity management
and the Grid middleware, have been the enablers of two Nobel prizes in Physics (2013 and 2017),
and many more data-driven scientific discoveries in high energy physics, astronomy and astrophysics,
health and medicine, and earth sciences resulting in more than 3,000 open access scientific
publications enabled each year. In this webinar Gergely will provide an overview of EGI,
the pan-european federation of national e-infrastructures and he will explain how EGI supports
big data based Open Science and contributes to the implementation of the EOSC vision. The talk goes
through the services that EGI provides for scientific communities, and for the members of the
federation, and will show how these services benefit research, science and innovation in Europe and worldwide.

<i>"Data Management in EGI with Rucio and FTS" (October, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5711/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Rucio (https://rucio.cern.ch/) is a data management software, originally developed
for ATLAS at CERN to supersede their previous data management software 10 years ago. Since then
Rucio has been constantly developed by ATLAS and other communities that have come to use Rucio,
ensuring that it is a feature rich, and well maintained open software.
<br/><br/>
Multi-VO Rucio implemented by the STFC in the UK hosts Rucio as a service for many communities.
This is to provide communities the opportunity to use Rucio for their data management solution,
without having to learn about, and host their own instance of Rucio.
<br/><br/>
FTS ( https://fts.web.cern.ch/fts/ ) is a low level data movement service, responsible for
reliable bulk transfer of files between storages. It’ s responsible for globally distributing
the majority of the LHC data across the WLCG infrastructure and it supports many communities is EGI. 
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we introduce the main functionalities and show how to interact with the services
in order to schedule transfers.

<i>"Using Dynamic DNS service in the EGI Cloud infrastructure" (June, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5559/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Nowadays, more and more services are dynamically deployed in Cloud environments.
Usually, the services hosted on virtual machines in Cloud are accessible only via IP addresses
or pre-configured hostnames given by the target Cloud providers, making it difficult to provide
them with meaningful domain names.
<br/><br/>
The Dynamic DNS service provides a unified, federation-wide Dynamic DNS support for VMs in
EGI infrastructure. Users can register their chosen meaningful and memorable DNS host names
in given domains (e.g. my-server.vo.fedcloud.eu) and assign to public IPs of their servers.
By using Dynamic DNS, users can host services in EGI Cloud with their meaningful service names,
can freely move VMs from sites to sites without modifying server/client configurations (federated approach),
and can request valid server certificates in advance (critical for security).
<br/><br/>
The webinar will provide demonstration and tutorial, also practical advice on using Dynamic DNS
service in realistic user scenarios.

<i>"Monitoring services with ARGO" (May, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5496/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: <a href="https://argo.egi.eu/">ARGO</a> is a lightweight
service for Service Level Monitoring designed for medium and large sized
Research Infrastructures. Services are monitored with probes compatible
with flexible and widely adopted Nagios plugin format. Besides basic availability
checks, services can be monitored by emulating typical user scenarios that allows
to derive the quality of service the actual user gets.
<br/><br/>
ARGO offers near real-time status updates which allow both end-users and site
admins to have an overview of the services offered at any given point in time
via a web user interface and via enriched email notifications. ARGO generates
custom Availability and Reliability reports based on the aggregated monitoring
data. The rich monitoring data collected in ARGO service is actually stored in
a highly flexible big data friendly form using state-of-the-art computational
pipelines and formats. This provides the ability to reuse & analyse the data in
different ways such as to highlight service usage patterns and provide a number
of trends and insights.
<br/><br/>
In this training session we are going to show the process we follow to monitor a
new service with ARGO. In addition, the real time computations and the results via
the alerts, API and UI will be shown.

<i>"CernVM-FS for Containers" (October 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5251/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Delivering complex software stacks across a worldwide distributed system
is a challenge in high-throughput scientific computing. The global-scale virtual file
system CernVM-FS distributes more than a billion software binaries to hundreds of thousands
of machines around the world.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar, we will present the latest developments with regard to CernVM-FS container
integration. Containers and CernVM-FS team up nicely: containers provide the isolation
capabilities that decouple the application stack from the underlying platform and CernVM-FS
provides efficient distribution means for the containerized software binaries. Containers are
an enabling technology to harness opportunistic resources and HPC facilities. CernVM-FS enables
the use of such resources at scale. In this webinar, we will show how existing repositories can
be used with several popular container runtimes, such as docker, podman, singularity, and kubernetes.
We will also show how operating system containers themselves can be efficiently distributed through
CernVM-FS. Lastly, we will highlight an upcoming new way of publishing content from within a container.
This makes it easy to set up, build and test and deploy-to-cvmfs pipelines on kubernetes.

<i>"The EGI Datahub to federate distributed data sets for data-intensive applications in the cloud" (June 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5089/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI DataHub allows users to make their data available using different
levels of access: from completely unrestricted open access to open data to authenticated
access to closed data sets. This is possible as a result of the seamless integration with
the EGI AAI service. The data hosted on the EGI DataHub can be readily accessible by cloud
Virtual Machines (VMs) or running grid jobs thanks to full integration with EGI Federated
Cloud and High-Throughput compute resources. The use of protocols such as POSIX and web
services guarantees easy and scalable access to data from cloud and HTC applications. This
ensures maximum compatibility with existing applications and minimum hassle for developers
and users alike. The EGI DataHub is built on top of the EGI Open Data Platform using Onedata
technology to connect a wide range of existing storage services, regardless of their underlying
technology (e.g. Lustre, Amazon S3, Ceph, NFS, or dCache).
<br/><br/>
During this webinar the QoS and hybrid cloud data processing scenarios for distributed EOSC
environments based on EGI DataHub and Onedata solutions will be introduced.

<i>"The EGI AAI Check-In service for scientific communities" (May 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5088/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI Check-in service (also called EGI AAI proxy) enables access to
EGI services and resources using federated authentication mechanisms. Specifically,
the proxy service is operated as a central hub between federated Identity Providers
(IdPs) residing ‘outside’ of the EGI ecosystem, and Service Providers (SPs) that are
part of EGI. The main advantage of this design principle is that all entities need to
establish and maintain technical and trust relation only to a single entity,
the EGI AAI proxy, instead of managing many-to-many relationships. In this context,
the proxy acts as a Service Provider towards the Identity Providers and as an Identity
Provider towards the Service Providers.
<br/><br/>
Through the EGI AAI proxy, users are able to authenticate with the credentials
provided by the IdP of their Home Organisation (e.g. via eduGAIN), as well as using
social identity providers, or other selected external identity providers (support for
eGOV IDs is also foreseen). To achieve this, the EGI AAI has built-in support for SAML,
OpenID Connect and OAuth2 providers and already enables user logins through Facebook,
Google, LinkedIn, and ORCID. In addition to serving as an authentication proxy, the
EGI AAI provides a central Discovery Service (Where Are You From – WAYF) for users to
select their preferred IdP.
<br/><br/>
The EGI AAI proxy is also responsible for aggregating user attributes originating
from various authoritative sources (IdPs and attribute provider services) and
delivering them to the connected EGI service providers in a harmonised and
transparent way. Service Providers can use the received attributes for authorisation
purposes, i.e. determining the resources the user has access to.
<br/><br/>
During this webinar we will give an overview about the service and provide
guidelines to support the resource providers’ and communities' needs for federated
access through the EGI AAI Check-In service. The webinar will also cover more advanced
workflows for addressing non-web-based access use cases (e.g. command line and API).

<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5087/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI Notebooks service is an environment based on Jupyter and the
EGI cloud service that offers a browser-based, scalable tool for interactive data analysis.
The notebooks environment provides users with notebooks where they can combine text,
mathematics, computations and rich media output. The service, in production since late 2019,
is offered in two options: (i) Notebooks for researchers: EGI offers a basic instance of the
Notebooks as an open service. Any researcher can access this automatically to write and play
notebooks on limited capacity cloud servers. (ii) Notebooks for communities: EGI offers customised
Notebooks service to scientific communities. Such customised instances can be hosted on special
hardware (for example with fat nodes and GPUs), can offer special libraries, data import/export
and user authentication systems.
<br/><br/>
During the webinar Enol will go through the main features of the EGI Notebooks service and
he will explain how to use it with Binder and other open-source solutions to implement Open Science.
