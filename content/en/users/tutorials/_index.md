<i>"EGI Federation - Advanced Computing for Research" (April 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5083/ 
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI federation is the largest distributed computing
infrastructure in the world, and brings together hundreds of data centres
worldwide and also includes the largest community cloud federation in Europe
with tens of cloud providers across most of the European countries offering
IaaS cloud and storage services. The current federated resources represent
altogether more than 350 Petabytes of online storage and 380 Petabytes of archival
storage supported by approximately 1 M Cores. EGI expanded the federation of its
facilities with other non-European digital infrastructures in North America,
South America, Africa-Arabia and the Asia-Pacific region, as such EGI fully
realised the “Open to the World” vision. In order to interoperate at international
level, EGI and its partners operate in the context of a lightweight collaboration
framework defining rules of participations via a corpus of policies and technical guidelines.
<br/><br/>
EGI offering includes a federated IaaS cloud to run compute- or data-intensive
tasks and host online services in virtual machines or docker containers on IT resources
accessible via a uniform interface; high-throughput data analysis to run compute-intensive
tasks for producing and analysing large datasets and store/retrieve research data efficiently
across multiple service providers; federated operations to manage service access and operations
from heterogeneous distributed infrastructures and integrate resources from multiple independent
providers with technologies, processes and expertise offered by EGI; consultancy for user-driven
innovation to assess research computing needs and provide tailored solutions for advanced computing.
<br/><br/>
The notion of a distributed infrastructure offering advanced resources and services for
data-intensive processing in research and innovation has been part of the EGI mission
and vision since the EGI design and implementation that started with the DataGrid project
back in 2000 under the leadership of CERN. Distributed processing of data supported by
a pan-European broadband network infrastructure, solutions for trust and identity management
and the Grid middleware, have been the enablers of two Nobel prizes in Physics (2013 and 2017),
and many more data-driven scientific discoveries in high energy physics, astronomy and astrophysics,
health and medicine, and earth sciences resulting in more than 3,000 open access scientific
publications enabled each year. In this webinar Gergely will provide an overview of EGI,
the pan-european federation of national e-infrastructures and he will explain how EGI supports
big data based Open Science and contributes to the implementation of the EOSC vision. The talk goes
through the services that EGI provides for scientific communities, and for the members of the
federation, and will show how these services benefit research, science and innovation in Europe and worldwide.

<i>"Data Management in EGI with Rucio and FTS" (October, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5711/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Rucio (https://rucio.cern.ch/) is a data management software, originally developed
for ATLAS at CERN to supersede their previous data management software 10 years ago. Since then
Rucio has been constantly developed by ATLAS and other communities that have come to use Rucio,
ensuring that it is a feature rich, and well maintained open software.
<br/><br/>
Multi-VO Rucio implemented by the STFC in the UK hosts Rucio as a service for many communities.
This is to provide communities the opportunity to use Rucio for their data management solution,
without having to learn about, and host their own instance of Rucio.
<br/><br/>
FTS ( https://fts.web.cern.ch/fts/ ) is a low level data movement service, responsible for
reliable bulk transfer of files between storages. It’ s responsible for globally distributing
the majority of the LHC data across the WLCG infrastructure and it supports many communities is EGI. 
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we introduce the main functionalities and show how to interact with the services
in order to schedule transfers.

<i>"Using Dynamic DNS service in the EGI Cloud infrastructure" (June, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5559/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Nowadays, more and more services are dynamically deployed in Cloud environments.
Usually, the services hosted on virtual machines in Cloud are accessible only via IP addresses
or pre-configured hostnames given by the target Cloud providers, making it difficult to provide
them with meaningful domain names.
<br/><br/>
The Dynamic DNS service provides a unified, federation-wide Dynamic DNS support for VMs in
EGI infrastructure. Users can register their chosen meaningful and memorable DNS host names
in given domains (e.g. my-server.vo.fedcloud.eu) and assign to public IPs of their servers.
By using Dynamic DNS, users can host services in EGI Cloud with their meaningful service names,
can freely move VMs from sites to sites without modifying server/client configurations (federated approach),
and can request valid server certificates in advance (critical for security).
<br/><br/>
The webinar will provide demonstration and tutorial, also practical advice on using Dynamic DNS
service in realistic user scenarios.

Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5496/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: <a href="https://argo.egi.eu/">ARGO</a> is a lightweight
service for Service Level Monitoring designed for medium and large sized
Research Infrastructures. Services are monitored with probes compatible
with flexible and widely adopted Nagios plugin format. Besides basic availability
checks, services can be monitored by emulating typical user scenarios that allows
to derive the quality of service the actual user gets.
<br/><br/>
ARGO offers near real-time status updates which allow both end-users and site
admins to have an overview of the services offered at any given point in time
via a web user interface and via enriched email notifications. ARGO generates
custom Availability and Reliability reports based on the aggregated monitoring
data. The rich monitoring data collected in ARGO service is actually stored in
a highly flexible big data friendly form using state-of-the-art computational
pipelines and formats. This provides the ability to reuse & analyse the data in
different ways such as to highlight service usage patterns and provide a number
of trends and insights.
<br/><br/>
In this training session we are going to show the process we follow to monitor a
new service with ARGO. In addition, the real time computations and the results via
the alerts, API and UI will be shown.

<br/><br/>
Agenda, slides and recording: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5492/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Containers provide a streamlined way to build, test, deploy,
and redeploy applications on different environments: from the developer’s
local machine to any cloud provider. Containers make it easy for developers
to package applications and for operators to manage and deploy those applications
on the infrastructure. Container orchestrators like Kubernetes facilitate the
management of containerized workloads and services, using declarative configuration
and automation. In this webinar we will introduce the different runtimes available
for executing containers in EGI infrastructure and will show how to manage Kubernetes
clusters to get your containers under control executed on EGI cloud providers.
