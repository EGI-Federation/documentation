## Overview

In this section you can find a series of Tutorials and Guides designed by the
members of the EGI Federation with the goal of providing researchers and
scientists with initial knowledge from which they can perform common tasks
in the EGI federated infrastructure.

The content is organised according to four different skill levels:

* **FOUNDATION** (or entry level): provides an overview of the
  EGI federation and of the EGI services, with highlights
  of their typical use cases.
* **INTERMEDIATE**: provides details on individual services from
  the EGI owned service portfolio, as well as services that are
  offered by the broader EGI community to complement the EGI services
  towards certain types of advanced computing use cases.
* **ADVANCED** (for more expert users): provides a deep-diving
  on the advanced services to conduct world-class research and innovation
  will be presented.
* **SCIENTIFIC**: presents examples of domain-specific Thematic Services
  benefiting from the solutions offered by the EGI Infrastructure.
