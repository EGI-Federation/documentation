  Tutorials for common uses cases in the EGI infrastructure
---

## Overview

In this section you can find a series of Tutorials and Guides designed by the
members of the EGI Federation with the goal of providing researchers and
scientists with initial knowledge from which they can perform common tasks
in the EGI federated infrastructure.

The content is organised according to four different skill levels:

* **FOUNDATION** (or entry level): provides an overview of the
  EGI federation and of the EGI services, with highlights
  of their typical use cases.
* **INTERMEDIATE**: provides details on individual services from
  the EGI owned service portfolio, as well as services that are
  offered by the broader EGI community to complement the EGI services
  towards certain types of advanced computing use cases.
* **ADVANCED** (for more expert users): provides a deep-diving
  on the advanced services to conduct world-class research and innovation
  will be presented.
* **SCIENTIFIC**: presents examples of domain-specific Thematic Services
  benefiting from the solutions offered by the EGI Infrastructure.

Recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1VAp3O6AtY&t=114s
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI Federation is an international e-Infrastructure to provide
advanced computing and data analytics services for research and innovation.
EGI federates compute resources, data management services, support teams
and various online, thematic services from over 30 countries and international
institutes, to make those available for researchers, innovators and educators.
This webinar will provide a basic introduction to EGI, covering all the
fundamental topics that you need to know before deep-diving on the advanced
services to conduct world-class research and innovation.

<i>"EGI Federation - Advanced Computing for Research" (April 2020)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5083/ 
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The EGI federation is the largest distributed computing
infrastructure in the world, and brings together hundreds of data centres
worldwide and also includes the largest community cloud federation in Europe
with tens of cloud providers across most of the European countries offering
IaaS cloud and storage services. The current federated resources represent
altogether more than 350 Petabytes of online storage and 380 Petabytes of archival
storage supported by approximately 1 M Cores. EGI expanded the federation of its
facilities with other non-European digital infrastructures in North America,
South America, Africa-Arabia and the Asia-Pacific region, as such EGI fully
realised the “Open to the World” vision. In order to interoperate at international
level, EGI and its partners operate in the context of a lightweight collaboration
framework defining rules of participations via a corpus of policies and technical guidelines.
<br/><br/>
EGI offering includes a federated IaaS cloud to run compute- or data-intensive
tasks and host online services in virtual machines or docker containers on IT resources
accessible via a uniform interface; high-throughput data analysis to run compute-intensive
tasks for producing and analysing large datasets and store/retrieve research data efficiently
across multiple service providers; federated operations to manage service access and operations
from heterogeneous distributed infrastructures and integrate resources from multiple independent
providers with technologies, processes and expertise offered by EGI; consultancy for user-driven
innovation to assess research computing needs and provide tailored solutions for advanced computing.
<br/><br/>
The notion of a distributed infrastructure offering advanced resources and services for
data-intensive processing in research and innovation has been part of the EGI mission
and vision since the EGI design and implementation that started with the DataGrid project
back in 2000 under the leadership of CERN. Distributed processing of data supported by
a pan-European broadband network infrastructure, solutions for trust and identity management
and the Grid middleware, have been the enablers of two Nobel prizes in Physics (2013 and 2017),
and many more data-driven scientific discoveries in high energy physics, astronomy and astrophysics,
health and medicine, and earth sciences resulting in more than 3,000 open access scientific
publications enabled each year. In this webinar Gergely will provide an overview of EGI,
the pan-european federation of national e-infrastructures and he will explain how EGI supports
big data based Open Science and contributes to the implementation of the EOSC vision. The talk goes
through the services that EGI provides for scientific communities, and for the members of the
federation, and will show how these services benefit research, science and innovation in Europe and worldwide.

<i>"Data Management in EGI with Rucio and FTS" (October, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5711/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Rucio (https://rucio.cern.ch/) is a data management software, originally developed
for ATLAS at CERN to supersede their previous data management software 10 years ago. Since then
Rucio has been constantly developed by ATLAS and other communities that have come to use Rucio,
ensuring that it is a feature rich, and well maintained open software.
<br/><br/>
Multi-VO Rucio implemented by the STFC in the UK hosts Rucio as a service for many communities.
This is to provide communities the opportunity to use Rucio for their data management solution,
without having to learn about, and host their own instance of Rucio.
<br/><br/>
FTS ( https://fts.web.cern.ch/fts/ ) is a low level data movement service, responsible for
reliable bulk transfer of files between storages. It’ s responsible for globally distributing
the majority of the LHC data across the WLCG infrastructure and it supports many communities is EGI. 
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we introduce the main functionalities and show how to interact with the services
in order to schedule transfers.

<i>"Using EGI Cloud infrastructure with fedcloudclient" (September, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5694/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The FedCloud client is a high-level Python package for a command-line client
designed for interaction with the OpenStack services in the EGI infrastructure. The client
can access various EGI services and can perform many tasks for users including managing
access tokens, listing services, and mainly execute commands on OpenStack sites in EGI infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
The webinar will provide tutorial and demonstration of using fedcloudclient in EGI Cloud infrastructure.

<i>"Using Dynamic DNS service in the EGI Cloud infrastructure" (June, 2021)</i>
<br/><br/>
Agenda: https://indico.egi.eu/event/5559/
<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: Nowadays, more and more services are dynamically deployed in Cloud environments.
Usually, the services hosted on virtual machines in Cloud are accessible only via IP addresses
or pre-configured hostnames given by the target Cloud providers, making it difficult to provide
them with meaningful domain names.
<br/><br/>
The Dynamic DNS service provides a unified, federation-wide Dynamic DNS support for VMs in
EGI infrastructure. Users can register their chosen meaningful and memorable DNS host names
in given domains (e.g. my-server.vo.fedcloud.eu) and assign to public IPs of their servers.
By using Dynamic DNS, users can host services in EGI Cloud with their meaningful service names,
can freely move VMs from sites to sites without modifying server/client configurations (federated approach),
and can request valid server certificates in advance (critical for security).
<br/><br/>
The webinar will provide demonstration and tutorial, also practical advice on using Dynamic DNS
service in realistic user scenarios.
