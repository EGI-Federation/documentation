To access services and resources in the [EGI Federated Cloud](../../getting-started),
you will need:

  that has access to the services and resources you need

usually done with a web dashboard/user interface, the examples in this tutorial
will make extensive use the [command-line interface](../../getting-started/cli)
(CLI).
