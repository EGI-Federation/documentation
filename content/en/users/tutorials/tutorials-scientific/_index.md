<b>About</b>: ODV (Ocean Data View) is a widely used software package for the analysis,
exploration and visualization of oceanographic and other environmental data with almost
100,000 registrations since the 1990’s and more than 10,000 active users. ODV has been
further developed as part of the EU supported activities of SeaDataNet, the pan-European
infrastructure for marine and ocean data management. To make working with web-based large
community datasets easier, an online version of the ODV software called webODV has been
developed, which provides typical ODV functionality in the form of web services. webODV
has been deployed in the cloud in the framework of the EU EGI-ACE project, which seeks
to promote scientific analytical cloud services in support of the European Open Science
Cloud (EOSC) initiative.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar, we will be able to learn about the webODV Explorer and Extractor
components in combination with the large validated Temperature & Salinity data collections
as provided by SeaDataNet and EuroArgo – Argo. Instructions on how to register as a user
to perform analytics, extractions, and visualisations will also be presented.

<i>"Can deep learning models help accelerate electrostatics-driven protein pKa predictions?" (Nov. 2022)</i>

<b>About</b>: pH is a crucial physicochemical property that affects proteins molecular structure,
folding, stability, and function. Many computational methods have been developed to calculate
pKa values. In the highly accurate, but slow, Poisson–Boltzmann (PB)-based methods, proteins are
represented by point charges in a low dielectric medium surrounded by an implicit solvent
(high dielectric). Empirical methods rely on statistically fitting parameters over large
datasets of experimental pKa values. These are much faster than the physics-based methods,
although at the cost of less microscopic insights and unknown predictive power on mutations
and proteins dissimilar to those in the training set.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we will present a novel strategy to combine the best features of PB
models – accuracy and interpretability – with the speed of classical empirical methods.
The deep learning pKa predictors obtained were trained on a database of 3M theoretical
pKa values estimated from 50k structures using a PB method. With this approach, we can
retrieve the physics-based predictions with an average error below 0.4 pK units while
being up to 1000x faster.

<b>About</b>: The Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP) is a web portal for medical simulation
and image data analysis. It leverages resources available in the EGI biomed Virtual
Organisation to offer an open service to academic researchers worldwide. In the last
few years, VIP has addressed interoperability and reproducibility concerns, in the larger
scope of a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) approach to scientific data analysis.
<br/><br/>
The presentation will give an overview of VIP and its main interests for the audience:
<ol>
<li>Use existing applications as a service on VIP.</li>
<li>Import your own applications to make them available to the community
benefit from EGI biomed resources in a transparent way and</li>
<li>Foster open and reproducible science</li>
</ol>

<b>About</b>: The ENES Data Space delivers an open, scalable and cloud-enabled data science
environment for climate data analysis on top of the EOSC Compute Platform. It provides access
to a set of specific Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) variable-centric collections
to support meteorological and industrial researchers in realistic climate model analysis experiments.
Data is downloaded and kept in sync with the  Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) federated data archive.
<br/><br/>
This webinar will provide a general overview of the ENES Data Space service and its main features.
Moreover, the webinar will include a tutorial on how to join the ENES Data Space service and a short demo
for the participants to get started with the data analysis and visualisation features.

<i>"WeNMR - Structural biology in the cloud - 10 years of experience of using EGI services" (April 2020)</i>

<b>About</b>: Structural biology deals with the characterization of the structural
(atomic coordinates) and dynamic (fluctuation of atomic coordinates over time) properties
of biological macromolecules and adducts thereof. Gaining insight into 3D structures of
biomolecules is highly relevant with numerous applications in health and food sciences,
with as current example unravelling the structural details of Sars-Cov2 in the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br/><br/>
Since 2010, the WeNMR project has implemented numerous web-based services to facilitate
the use of advanced computational tools by researchers in the field, using the grid computational
infrastructure provided by EGI. These services have been further developed in subsequent initiatives
under the H2020 EGI-ENGAGE West-Life project and the BioExcel Center of Excellence for Biomolecular
Computational Research. The WeNMR services are currently operating under the European Open Science
Cloud with the H2020 EOSC-Hub project, with the HADDOCK portal sending >10 millions jobs and using
~2700 CPU years  per year. In my talk, I will summarise 10 years of successful use of e-infrastructure
solutions to serve a large worldwide community of users (>16’000 to date), providing them with
user-friendly, web-based solutions that allow to run complex workflows in structural biology.
I will illustrate this with details of the HADDOCK service and how we could increase our capacity
to serve COVID-related projects.
