an easy-to-use web interface, designed for users to deploy a set of predefined and well-tested customisable
virtual infrastructures on top of a wide range of cloud providers with a set of mouse clicks.
Furthermore, it uses a two-step wizard that enables it to compose more complex templates,
as shown in the demo.

<b>About</b>: FAIR EVA (Evaluator, Validator and Advisor) has been developed to check
the FAIRness level of digital objects from different repositories or data portals.
It requires the object identifier and the repository to check and it can be adapted
to different contexts and environments. Developed within the EOSC-Synergy project it
aims at helping data producers and data managers to evaluate the adoption of the FAIR
principles based on the RDA indicators. This webinar will present the tool as well as
show how it can be deployed, how the different tests work and how it can be adapted
to different data systems.

<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: <a href="https://openbis.ch/index.php/openrdm-swiss/">openRDM.eu</a>
provides FAIR research data management. It offers research data management as a service
to the scientific community, based on the powerful <a href="https://openbis.ch/">openBIS platform</a>.
The service is available as a preview version containing an openBIS instance. Preview is
intended for end-users to learn service & eventually plan on-premise and/or, own cloud based
deployment. Alternatively, self-hosting using local IT infrastructure at the respective institution
can also be agreed. Consulting & support for on-premise and/or own cloud based deployment of openBIS
is also offered along with user support including data model generation, to be able to import data
into openBIS & training for the use of openBIS as a data management platform.
<br/><br/>
OpenBIS is designed to facilitate robust data management for a wide variety of experiment types
and research subjects. It allows tracking, annotating, and sharing of data throughout distributed
research projects in different quantitative sciences.

<i>"How to orchestrate services in the EOSC Compute Platform with the INDIGO PaaS" (Oct. 2021)</i>

<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: The INDIGO PaaS implements an abstraction and federation layer on top
of heterogeneous distributed computing environments: it allow to orchestrate and
coordinate the provisioning of virtualized compute and storage resources on Cloud
Management Frameworks, both private and public (like OpenStack, OpenNebula, AWS, etc.),
and the deployment of dockerized long-running services and batch jobs on Container Orchestration
Platforms like Apache Mesos and Kubernetes.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar, we will describe the architecture of the INDIGO Platform and its
main features. The demo will show how users can easily interact with this orchestration
system using both the command line interface and the web dashboard.

<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: DODAS enables the execution of user analysis code both in batch mode
and interactively via the Jupyter interface. DODAS is highly customizable and offers
several building blocks that can be combined together in order to create the best
service composition for a given use case. The currently available blocks allow to
combine Jupyter and HTCondor as well as Jupyter and Spark or simply a jupyter interface.
In addition, they allow the management of data via caches to optimise the processing
of remote data. This can be done either via XCache or MinIO S3 object storage capabilities.
DODAS is based on docker containers and the related orchestration relies on Kubernetes
that enables the possibility to compose the building blocks via a web-based user interface thanks to Kubeapps.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we will explain the DODAS fundamentals and we will provide a user oriented demo.

<br/><br/>
<b>About</b>: udocker enables the execution of docker containers in user
space without requiring root privileges for installation or use. Udocker
implements the pull, load, import and execution of containers by non-privileged
users in Linux systems where docker is not available. It can be used in Linux batch
systems and interactive clusters that are managed by other entities, such as grid
infrastructures or externally managed batch or interactive systems. udocker does not
require any type of privileges nor the deployment of services by system administrators.
It can be downloaded and executed entirely by the end user.
<br/><br/>
udocker offers several execution modes exploiting system call interception, library call
interception and namespaces. udocker integrates several tools to provide a subset of the
docker capabilities aimed at container execution.
<br/><br/>
In this webinar we will explain the udocker fundamental, how to use udocker to execute
Linux containers and how to best exploit the several execution engines.

<b>About</b>: The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware integrates computing resources
(usually, computing clusters managed by a batch system), making them available via a secure
common layer. Conceptually, ARC provides an edge service to batch systems. Through this service,
called ARC Compute Element (ARC-CE), scientific communities can launch and manage computational
tasks in a uniform manner.
<br/><br/>
A bit more than a year ago a non backward compatible major version, the ARC6.0 was released
bringing new functionality, enhanced manageability and increased stability to the community.
With the availability of the ARC6 release the support for the previous ARC5 deployments are
to be discontinued with the end of June 2020.
<br/><br/>
This interactive webinar will introduce the major new features of the ARC6 release and cover
the deployment steps of an ARC6 CE  both as a new installation and as an upgrade from a previous
ARC5-based deployment. Special attention will be given to the accounting system related changes
and the new one-shop-stop sysadmin toolbox built around arcctl.
