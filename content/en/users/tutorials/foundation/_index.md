<b>About</b>: The EGI Federation is an international e-Infrastructure to provide
advanced computing and data analytics services for research and innovation.
EGI federates compute resources, data management services, support teams
and various online, thematic services from over 30 countries and international
institutes, to make those available for researchers, innovators and educators.
This webinar will provide a basic introduction to EGI, covering all the
fundamental topics that you need to know before deep-diving on the advanced
services to conduct world-class research and innovation.

<b>About</b>: The EGI federation is the largest distributed computing
infrastructure in the world, and brings together hundreds of data centres
worldwide and also includes the largest community cloud federation in Europe
with tens of cloud providers across most of the European countries offering
IaaS cloud and storage services. The current federated resources represent
altogether more than 350 Petabytes of online storage and 380 Petabytes of archival
storage supported by approximately 1 M Cores. EGI expanded the federation of its
facilities with other non-European digital infrastructures in North America,
South America, Africa-Arabia and the Asia-Pacific region, as such EGI fully
realised the “Open to the World” vision. In order to interoperate at international
level, EGI and its partners operate in the context of a lightweight collaboration
framework defining rules of participations via a corpus of policies and technical guidelines.
<br/><br/>
EGI offering includes a federated IaaS cloud to run compute- or data-intensive
tasks and host online services in virtual machines or docker containers on IT resources
accessible via a uniform interface; high-throughput data analysis to run compute-intensive
tasks for producing and analysing large datasets and store/retrieve research data efficiently
across multiple service providers; federated operations to manage service access and operations
from heterogeneous distributed infrastructures and integrate resources from multiple independent
providers with technologies, processes and expertise offered by EGI; consultancy for user-driven
innovation to assess research computing needs and provide tailored solutions for advanced computing.
<br/><br/>
The notion of a distributed infrastructure offering advanced resources and services for
data-intensive processing in research and innovation has been part of the EGI mission
and vision since the EGI design and implementation that started with the DataGrid project
back in 2000 under the leadership of CERN. Distributed processing of data supported by
a pan-European broadband network infrastructure, solutions for trust and identity management
and the Grid middleware, have been the enablers of two Nobel prizes in Physics (2013 and 2017),
and many more data-driven scientific discoveries in high energy physics, astronomy and astrophysics,
health and medicine, and earth sciences resulting in more than 3,000 open access scientific
publications enabled each year. In this webinar Gergely will provide an overview of EGI,
the pan-european federation of national e-infrastructures and he will explain how EGI supports
big data based Open Science and contributes to the implementation of the EOSC vision. The talk goes
through the services that EGI provides for scientific communities, and for the members of the
federation, and will show how these services benefit research, science and innovation in Europe and worldwide.
