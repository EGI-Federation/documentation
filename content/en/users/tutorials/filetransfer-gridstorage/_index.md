This tutorial describes how to perform a transfer usin FTS transfers services
and WebFTS.

## Prerequisites

As first step please make sure that you have installed the FTS client as
described in [Data Transfer](../../data-transfer/), and in particular
[Clients](../../data-transfer/clients/) for the command line FTS and to have
yourcertificates installed in your browser to use WebFTS
[WebFTS](../../data-transfer/webfts/) browser based client.

To access services and resources in the
[EGI Federated Cloud](../../getting-started), you will need:

- An EGI ID (account), you can [sign up here](../../check-in/signup)
- Enrollment into a [Virtual Organisation](../../check-in/vos) (VO) that has
  access to the services and resources you need

Although provisioning, configuration, and access to EGI Cloud services is
usually done with a web dashboard/user interface, the examples in this tutorial
will make extensive use the [command line interface](../../getting-started/cli)
(CLI).
