## How do I install library _X_?

You can install new software easily on the notebooks using `conda` or `pip`. The
`%conda` and `%pip`
[magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-conda)
can be used in a cell of your notebooks to do so, e.g. installing `rdkit`:

```{.pycon}
%conda install rdkit
```

Once installed you can import the library as usual.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}} Any modifications to the
libraries/software of your notebooks will be lost when your notebook server is
stopped (automatically after 1 hour of inactivity)! {{% /alert %}}
