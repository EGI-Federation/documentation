  User documentation that only applies for specific services providers
---

Some service providers in the EGI Federation publish documentation about how
to work with their sites. Below is a list:

- [CESNET-MCC](https://docs.cloud.muni.cz/)
- [IFCA-LCG2](https://confluence.ifca.es/display/IC/Computing+Resources)
- [IN2P3-IRES](https://scigne.fr/en/user-support/online-documentation/)

This information is handy to deal with the particularities of the services
deployed by a given provider. It usually covers OpenStack deployments,
but may also document other services.
