[Chipster](http://chipster.csc.fi/) is a user-friendly software for analysing
high-throughput data such as NGS and microarrays and provided as part of EGI\'s
AoD service.

The software contains over 400 analysis tools and a large collection of
reference genomes.

Users can save and share automatic analysis workflows, and visualize data
interactively using for example the built-in genome browser.

## EGI Chipster
