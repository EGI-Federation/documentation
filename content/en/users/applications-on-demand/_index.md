  The Applications on Demand (AoD) service
---

The
[EGI Applications on Demand (AoD) service](https://www.egi.eu/services/applications-on-demand/)
is EGI's response to the requirements of researchers who are interested in using
applications in a on-demand fashion together with the compute and storage
environment needed to compute and store data.

You can order and access the service through the
[EGI Marketplace](https://marketplace.egi.eu).

## Service Description

The service combines compute and storage cloud with Application-development and
hosting frameworks to run custom scientific applications, and/or to turn those
into applications into online data analysis services that can be accessed by
scientists worldwide.

The portfolio of applications is currently composed by a readily available set
of applications relevant to different scientific and research areas. This
portfolio is open to be extended thanks to the contributions of users of the
service. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us: support
(at) egi.eu

### Intended user groups

The main target groups of this service are:

- Application developers who want to make their applications and tools
  accessible in a scalable way for researchers internationally.
- Algorithm developers (researchers) who want to run their own codes at scale in
  a compute cloud.

The main target groups of the applications that are already hosted in this
service are:

- Researchers and innovators who want to run a specific scientific application
  that is already available in the platform.

### Scientific applications

The scientific applications that are already available in this service are:

- [Chipster](https://marketplace.egi.eu/applications-on-demand/68-chipster.html)
  a user-friendly analysis software for high-throughput data. It contains over
  300 analysis tools for next generation sequencing (NGS), microarray,
  proteomics and sequence data. The application is available through the Science
  Software on Demand Service (SSoD). Instructions to run the application are
  available [here](https://docs.egi.eu/users/applications-on-demand/chipster/).
- [NAMD](https://marketplace.egi.eu/applications-on-demand/58-namd.html) a
  parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of
  large bio-molecular systems. The application is available through the EC3
  portal.
- [ECAS](https://marketplace.egi.eu/applications-on-demand/84-ecas.html) a
  complete environment enabling data analysis experiments from the ENES Climate
  Analytics Service.

The service includes:

- Cloud compute and storage
  [resources](https://documents.egi.eu/public/ShowDocument?docid=2773) to host
  and scale up scientific applications.

- Cloud access and application-hosting frameworks (to run and to operate your
  own scientific application in the cloud environment): that offer integrated
  development environments to port custom applications with cloud resources.
- [VMOps dashboard](https://dashboard.appdb.egi.eu/vmops): a graphical
  environment for the management of Virtual Machines (VM) in the federated
  network of clouds that enable the Applications on Demand service. User
  documentation is available
  [here](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:what_is_the_vmops_dashboard).
- [Elastic Cloud Compute Cluster (EC3)](https://servproject.i3m.upv.es/ec3-ltos/index.php):
  a portal that allows the creation of elastic virtual clusters in the cloud.
  Those clusters can then host your scientific application either directly, or
  via Apache Mesos, Chronos, Kubernetes, Marathon,
  [OSCAR](https://github.com/grycap/oscar) or SLURM. Instructions for
  application developers are available
  [here](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Applications_on_Demand_Service_-_information_for_developers#How_to_integrate_a_new_application_in_EC3).

- [Science Software on Demand (SSoD)](https://fgsg.ct.infn.it/egissod/web/ssod):
  a programmable interface of a RESTful API Server to provide an easy access
  PaaS layer by leveraging recent Web technologies. Instructions for application
  developers are available
  [here](https://futuregateway-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Requirements and user registration

The service is open for any scientific software developer who needs a scalable
and user-friendly application execution and hosting environment to offer
data/compute intensive scientific applications online.

Access **requires** acceptance of
[Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Conditions of the \'EGI Applications on Demand Service\'](https://documents.egi.eu/public/ShowDocument?docid=2635).

{{% alert title="Acknowledgment" color="info" %}}

Users of the service are asked to provide appropriate acknowledgement of the use
in scientific publications. The following acknowledgement text can be used for
this purpose:

**This work used the EGI Applications on Demand service, which is co-funded by
the EOSC-hub project (grant number 777536). The HNSciCloud project (grant
number 687614) is also sponsoring the service, allowing users to access the
HNSciCloud services pilot for limited scale usage using the voucher schemes
provided by the Exoscale contractor.** {{% /alert %}}

When requesting access to AoD users are guided through a lightweight
registration process. Members of the EGI support team will perform a lightweight
vetting process to validate the users\' requests before granting the access to
the resources.

### Service grant

Once granted access, each user will have a grant with a pre-defined quota of
resources, which can be used to run the application of choice. This grant
includes:

- up to 4 CPU cores,
- 8 GB of RAM,
- 100GB of block storage.

The grant to run applications is initially valid for 6 months and can be
extended/renewed upon request.

### How can you access the service?

1. Login to the [EGI Marketplace](https://marketplace.egi.eu) with the EGI AAI
   Check-In service.
1. Setup a profile, including details about your affiliation and role within a
   research institute/project/team.
1. Navigate the marketplace top-menu and click on the category:
   **Applications**.
1. Click on the **Applications on Demand** service and submit an order for one
   of the available applications.
1. When the request is approved, run the requested application(s) as described
   below.
