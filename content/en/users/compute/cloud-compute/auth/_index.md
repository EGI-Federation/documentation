  Authentication and Authorisation in EGI Cloud

## Authentication {#oidc-auth-using-check-in}

[OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) is the main authentication protocol
used on the EGI Cloud. It replaces the legacy VOMS-based authentication for all
OpenStack providers.

Authentication to web based services (like the AppDB) will redirect you to the
EGI Check-in authentication page. Just select your institution or social login
and follow the regular authentication process.

Access to APIs or via command-line interfaces (CLI) requires the use of OAuth2.0
tokens and interaction with the OpenStack Keystone
[OS-FEDERATION API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3-ext/index.html#os-federation-api).
The process for authentication is as follows:

1. Obtain a valid OAuth2.0 access token from Check-in. Access tokens are
   short-lived credentials that can be obtained by recognised Check-in clients
   once a user has been authenticated.
1. Interchange the Check-in access token for a valid unscoped Keystone token.
1. Discover available projects from Keystone using the unscoped token.
1. Use the unscoped Keystone token to get a scoped token for a valid project.
   Scoped tokens will allow the user to perform operations on the provider.

## Authorisation

Cloud Compute service is accessed through **Virtual Organisations (VOs)**. Users
that are members of a VO will have access to the providers supporting that VO:
they will be able to manage VMs, block storage and object storage available to
the VO. Resources (VMs and storage) are shared across all members of the VO,
please do not interfere with the VMs of other users if you are not entitled to
do so (specially do not delete them).

Some users roles have special consideration in VOs:

- Users with VO Manager, VO Deputy or VO Expert Role have extra privileges in
  the AppDB for managing the Virtual Appliances to be available at every
  provider. Check the [Virtual Machine Image Management documentation](../images)
  for more information.

### Pilot VO

The
[vo.access.egi.eu Virtual Organisation](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/view/voname/vo.access.egi.eu)
serves as a test ground for users to try the Cloud Compute service and to
prototype and validate applications. It can be used for up to 6 month by any new
user.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

- After the 6-month long membership in the vo.access.egi.eu VO, you will need to
  move to a production VO, or establish a new VO.
- The resources are not guaranteed and may be removed without notice by
  providers. **Back-up frequently to avoid losing your work!**

{{% /alert %}}

For joining this VO, just place an order in the
[EGI Marketplace](https://marketplace.egi.eu/31-cloud-compute) and once approved
you will be able to interact with the infrastructure.

### Other VOs

Pre-existing VOs of EGI can be also used on IaaS cloud providers. Consult with
your VO manager or browse the existing VOs at the
[EGI Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/a/list).

## Check-in and access tokens

Access tokens can be obtained via several mechanisms, usually involving the use
of a web server and a browser. Command-line clients/APIs without access to a
browser or interactive prompt for user authentication can use refresh tokens. A
refresh token is a special token that is used to generate additional access
tokens. This allows you to have short-lived access tokens without having to
collect credentials every single time one expires. You can request this token
alongside the access and/or ID tokens as part of a user's initial authentication
flow.

If you need to obtain these kind of tokens for using it in command-line tools or APIs,
you can easily do so with the special _fedcloud_ client. You can access the
[FedCloud Check-in client](https://aai.egi.eu/fedcloud) and click on
\'Authorise\' to log in with your Check-in credentials to obtain:

- a client ID (`fedcloud`)
- a refresh token

{{% alert title="Refresh tokens" color="danger" %}}

Refresh tokens should be treated with care! This is a secret that can be used to
impersonate you in the infrastructure. It is recommended not to store them in
plain text.{{% /alert %}}

Alternatively, you can use the
[oidc-agent](https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/user/oidc-gen/provider/egi)
tool that is able to manage your tokens locally, or the
[fedcloud](https://fedcloudclient.fedcloud.eu/) client executed inside
[EGI Notebooks](../../../dev-env/notebooks/integration/#fedcloud-client).

### Discovering projects in Keystone

The _access token_ will provide you access to a cloud provider, but you may have
access to several different projects within that provider (a project can be
considered equivalent to a VO allocation). In order to discover which projects
are available you can do that using the Keystone API.

You can use the [fedcloud](https://fedcloudclient.fedcloud.eu/) client to
simplify the discovery of projects.

```shell
# Get a list of sites (also available in [AppDB](https://appdb.egi.eu))
fedcloud site list
# Get list of projects that you are allowed to access
# You can either specify the name of the account in your oidc-agent configuration
# or directly a valid access token
fedcloud endpoint projects --site=<name of the site> \
         [--oidc-agent-account <account name>|--oidc-access-token <access token>]
# You can also use environment variables for the configuration
export EGI_SITE=<name of the site>
export OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
fedcloud endpoint projects
# or with  oidc-agent
export OIDC_AGENT_ACCOUNT=<account name>
fedcloud enpoint projects
```

### Using the OpenStack API

Once you know which project to use, you can use your regular openstack cli
commands for performing actual operations in the provider:

```shell
fedcloud openstack image list --site <NAME_OF_SITE> --vo <NAME_OF_VO>
```

For third-party tools that can use token based authentication in OpenStack, use
the following command:

```shell
export OS_TOKEN=$(fedcloud openstack --site <NAME_OF_SITE> --vo <NAME_OF_VO> \
                  token issue -c id -f value)
```

## Legacy X.509 AAI

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

OpenID Connect is the preferred federated identity technology on EGI Cloud. Use
of X.509 certificates should be limited to legacy applications. {{% /alert %}}

[VOMS](https://italiangrid.github.io/voms/index.html) uses X.509 proxies
extended with VO information for authentication and authorisation on the
providers. You can learn about X.509 certificates and VOMS in the
[Check-in documentation](../../../aai/check-in/vos/voms).

### VOMS configuration

Valid configuration for `fedcloud.egi.eu` is available on the
[FedCloud client VM](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vappliance/egi.fedcloud.clients)
as generated by the
[fedcloud-ui installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGI-FCTF/fedcloud-userinterface/master/fedcloud-ui.sh).

VOMS client expects your certificate and private key to be available at
`$HOME/.globus/usercert.pem` and `$HOME/.globus/userkey.pem` respectively.

### Access the providers

VOMS authentication differs from one provider to another depending on the
technology used. There are 3 different cases handled automatically by the
`rOCCI-cli`. For accessing native OpenStack sites there are two different
plugins available for Keystone that are installed with a single library:

```shell
pip install openstack-voms-auth-type
```

For Keystone-VOMS based installations (Keystone URL ending on `/v2.0`), just
define the location of your proxy and `v2voms` as authorisation plugin:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```shell
openstack --os-auth-url https://<keystone-url>/v2.0 \
          --os-auth-type v2voms --os-x509-user-proxy /tmp/x509up_u1000 \

For those Keystone installations supporting only `v3`, specify `v3voms` as
authorisation plugin, `egi.eu` as identity provider, `mapped` as protocol, and
the location of your proxy:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```shell
openstack --os-auth-url https://<keystone url>/v3 \
