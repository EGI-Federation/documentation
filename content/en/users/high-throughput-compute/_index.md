## What is High Throughput Compute?

High Throughput Compute (HTC) can be described as computing paradigm that
focuses on the efficient execution of a large number of loosely-coupled tasks
(that could be data analysis tasks, also computing jobs for analysing data or
other similar tasks). HTC systems are independent jobs that can be individually
scheduled on many different computing resources across multiple administrative
boundaries. Users usually submit these tasks to the infrastructure as jobs and
once the jobs have been scheduled and executed in the distributed resources of
the infrastructure, the user can collect the output from the services that have
executed their jobs.

The EGI High Throughput Compute service is provided by a distributed network of
computing centres, accessible via a standard interface and membership of a
Virtual Organisation.

## The EGI High Throughput Compute Infrastructure

The EGI High Throughput Compute infrastructure is the federation of GRID
resources provided by EGI providers, that aims to share and federate in a secure
way distributed IT resources as part of the EGI infrastructure. It comprises:

- Computer resources -- execution environment of computing tasks in clusters
  distributed in many different resource centers over Europe and outside Europe
  ;
- Data infrastructure -- storage servers where users can upload and download
  their data/files in a distributed manner in the different resource centers
- Federated operations -- a set of federated operations that are constituted of
  global tasks (central activities/ services, e.g., AAI, accounting, helpdesk)
  that are needed to federate the heterogeneous resources from different
  resource centers and their operation activities that are carried out by the
  different NGIs.
- User support -- NGIs also carry out user support. EGI.eu provides the central
  user support and coordinates NGIs’ support activities.

## Target Users

The target customers for EGI High Throughput Compute service are research
communities who need to share, store, process, and produce large sets of data.
Typically, their research collaborations involve different organizations across
Europe and the world. They may already have local resources, for example,
universities, and research institutions, and these local resources normally can
only be accessed by local users, according to the organisational authentication
rules and access policies. For example, university researchers can go to their
IT department and ask for grant access to the university cluster. However, when
researchers join collaborations that need to share their research activities,
data collections, repositories among different organisations, they will need
more homogenous and coordinated operation of the resources that are not
currently uniformly accessible. In addition, nowadays, many researcher
collaborations generate a big amount of data, and managing such big data is time
consuming and error prone.

The EGI High Throughput Compute not only provides the basic access to resources
but also offers a set of high-level tools allowing users to manage a large
amount of data in a collaborative, for example, there are authorization and
access control tools that can be regulated by the research collaboration in a
central manner and uniformly distributed in the distributed infrastructure. And
there are also tools to handle and manage a big amount of data (to move data, to
create data catalogs for the distributed datasets, to balance the execution
workloads, etc.).

## Main features

EGI High Throughput Compute provides easy access to shared computing and data
services from independent resource providers in a uniform way optimizing usage.
Most software deployed in the distributed resources centers are based on open
standards, and are open source middleware services. Resource access is based on
Virtual Organisation (VO). VOs are fully managed by communities allowing them to
manage their users and grant control access to their services and resources. In
order to optimize the usage of the resources, users can have opportunistic usage
of unused resources. This means users can either own their resources and use EGI
services to federate them and have easy access to them or use the resources
already available in the EGI infrastructure. The opportunity resources are not
dedicated to the users’ organization, but since you are enabled in these
resources as the part of the EGI infrastructure, you can access when the
research centers have some spare resources. And in this way, the resource
providers are also happy since their resources are used in a more efficient way.

In summary, the main feature of the EGI High Throughput Compute service are as
follows:

- Access to high-quality computing resources
- Integrated monitoring and accounting tools to provide information about the
  availability and resource consumption
- Workload and data management tools to manage all computational tasks
- Large amounts of processing capacity over long periods of time
- Faster results for your research
- Shared resources among users, enabling collaborative research

### EGI High Throughput Compute Architecture and the Access Models

#### Architecture and Service Components

![EGI High Throughput Compute architecture](htc_archtecture.png)

Key Components:

- [Data Transfer Service (FTS)](../data-transfer/)
- [Storage Services](../online-storage/)
- _Computing Elements (CE)_: Computing resources are made available through GRID
  interfaces called Computing Elements. The most common implementations of CEs
  in the EGI infrastructure are
  [HTCondor-CE](https://htcondor-ce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
  [ARC-CE](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/ce/).

#### Access Models

Access to EGI High Throughput Compute resources is based on
[Virtual Organisations](../getting-started/#virtual-organisations-vos), you will
need to enrol into one VO before using the service. VOs for the EGI High
Throughput Compute service relies on
[X.509 proxy certificates with VOMS extensions](../check-in/vos/voms).
