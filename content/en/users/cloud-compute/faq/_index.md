## Basics

### How can I get access to the cloud compute service?

There is a VO available for 6 months piloting activities that any researcher in
Europe can join. Just place an order into the
[EGI Marketplace](https://marketplace.egi.eu/31-cloud-compute).

### How can I get an OAuth2.0 token?

Authentication via CLI or API requires a valid Check-in token. The
[FedCloud Check-in client](https://aai.egi.eu/fedcloud) allows you to get one as
needed. Check the [Authentication and Authorisation](../auth) guide for more
information.

### Is OCCI still supported?

OCCI is now deprecated as API for the EGI Cloud providers using OpenStack. Some
providers still support OCCI (a list of active endpoints can be queried at
[GOCDB](https://goc.egi.eu/portal/index.php?Page_Type=Services&serviceType=eu.egi.cloud.vm-management.occi&selectItemserviceType=eu.egi.cloud.vm-management.occi&ngi=&searchTerm=&production=TRUE&monitored=&certStatus=Certified&mscope%5B%5D=FedCloud&selectItemmscope%5B%5D=FedCloud&scopeMatch=all&servKeyNames=&servKeyValue=))
but it should note be used for any new developments.

Migration from rOCCI CLI to OpenStack CLI is quite straightforward, we summarize
the main commands in rOCCI and OpenStack equivalent in the table below:

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

If you still rely on OCCI for your access, please contact us at
`support _at_ egi.eu` for support on the migration. OpenNebula sites still use
OCCI as main API, but its direct use is not recommended as the support will be
deprecated. Instead use an Orchestrator like IM for interacting with those
sites.

## Discovery

### How can I get the list of the EGI Cloud providers?

The list of certified providers is available in [GOCDB](https://goc.egi.eu). The
`egicli endpoint list` command can help you to get that list:

```

The providers also generate dynamic information about their characteristics via
the Argo Messaging System which is easily browsable from AppDB.

### How can I choose which site to use?

Sites offer their resources to users through Virtual Organisations (VO). First,
you need to join a Virtual Organisation that matches your research interests,
see [authorisation section](../auth) on how VOs work. AppDB shows the supported
VOs and for each VO you can browse the resource providers that support it.

### How can I get information about the available VM images?

The [Application Database](https://appdb.egi.eu) contains information about the
VM images available in the EGI Cloud. Within the AppDB Cloud Marketplace, you
can look for a VM and get all the information about which VO the VM is
associated, the sites where the VM is available and the endpoints and
identifiers to use it in practice.

## Managing VMs

### The disk on my VM is full, how can I get more space?

There are several ways to increase the disk space available at the VM. The
fastest and easiest one is to use block storage, creating a new storage disk
device and attaching it to the VM. Check the [storage guide](../storage) for
more information.

### How can I keep my data after the VM is stopped?

After a VM has been stopped and unless backed up in a block storage volume, all
data in the VM is destroyed and cannot be recovered. To ensure your data will be
available after the VM is deleted, you need to use some form of persistent
storage.

### How can I assign a public IP to my VM?

Some providers do not automatically assign a public IP address to a VM during
the creation phase. In this case, you can attach a public IP by first allocating
a new public IP and then assigning it to the VM.

### How can I assign a DNS name to my VM?

If you need a domain name for your VMs, we offer a Dynamic DNS service that
allows any EGI user to create names for VMs under the _fedcloud.eu_ domain.

Just go to [EGI Cloud nsupdate](https://nsupdate.fedcloud.eu) and login with
your Check-in account. Once in, you can click on \"Add host\" to register a new
hostname in an available domain.

### What is contextualisation?

Contextualisation is the process of installing, configuring and preparing
software upon boot time on a pre-defined virtual machine image. This way, the
pre-defined images can be stored as generic and small as possible, since
customisations will take place on boot time.

Contextualisation is particularly useful for:

- Configuration not known until instantiation (e.g. data location).
- Private Information (e.g. host certs)
- Software that changes frequently or under development.

Contextualisation requires passing some data to the VMs on instantiation (the
context) and handling that context in the VM.

### How can I inject my public SSH key into the machine?

The best way to login into the virtual server is to use SSH keys. If you don\'t
have one, you need to generate it with the `ssh-keygen` command:

```shell
ssh-keygen -f fedcloud
```

This will generate two files:

- `fedcloud`, the private key. This file should never be shared
- `fedcloud.pub`, the public key. That will be sent to your VM.

To inject the public SSH key into the VM you can use the `key-name` option when
creating the VM in OpenStack. Check
[keypair management](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/keypair.html)
option in OpenStack documentation. This key will be available for the default
configured user of the VM (e.g. `ubuntu` for Ubuntu, `centos` for CentOS).

You can also create users with keys with a contextualisation file:

```yaml
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: cloudadm
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    lock-passwd: true
    ssh-import-id: cloudadm
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - <paste here the contents of your SSH key pub file>
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}} YAML format requires that the
spaces at the beginning of each line is respected in order to be correctly
parsed by `cloud-init`. {{% /alert %}}

### How can I use a contextualisation file?

If you have a contextualisation file, you can use it with the `--user-data`
option to `server create` in OpenStack.

```shell
openstack server create --flavor <your-flavor> --image <your image> \
          --user-data <your contextualisation file> \
          <server name>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} We recommend using `cloud-init` for
contextualisation. EGI images in AppDB do support `cloud-init`. Check the
[documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/) for more information.
{{% /alert %}}

### How can I pass secrets to my VMs?

EGI Cloud endpoints use **HTTPS** so information passed to contextualise the VMs
can be assumed to be safe and only readable within your VM. However, take into
account that anyone with access to the VM may be able to access also the
contextualisation information.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}} Take into account that anyone with
access to the VM may be able to access also the contextualisation information,
so ensure that no sensitive data like clear text passwords is used during
contextualisation. {{% /alert %}}

### How can I use ansible?

Ansible relies on ssh for accessing the servers it will configure. VMs at EGI
Cloud can be also accessed via ssh, just make sure you inject the correct public
keys in the VMs to be able to access.

If you don\'t have public IPs for all the VMs to be managed, you can also use
one as a gateway as described in the
[Ansible FAQ](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to).

### How can I release resources without destroying my data?

Whenever you delete a VM, the ephemeral disks associated with it will be also
deleted. If you don't plan to use your VM for some time, there are several
ways to release resources consumed by the VM (e.g. CPU, RAM) and  recover the
the data or boot your VM in a previous state when you need it back. We list
below the main strategies you can use:

- Use a volume to store the data to be kept: Check the [Storage section of the
  documentation](../storage) to learn how to use volumes. If you start your VM
  from a volume, the VM can be destroyed and recreated easily. OpenStack
  documentation cover how to [start a VM from a volume with CLI](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/launch-instance-from-volume.html)
  or [using the Horizon dashboard](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/launch-instances.html)

- Suspend or shelve instance: Suspending a VM will pause a VM, releasing CPU
  and memory, and allowing to resume later in time at the exact same state.
  Shelving shuts down the VM, thus RAM contents will be lost but disk will be
  kept. This releases more resources from the provider while still allows to
  easily boot the VM back without losing disk contents.

- Create snapshot of instance: a snapshot will create a new VM image at your
  provider that can be used to boot a new instance of the VM with the same
  disk content. You can use this technique for creating a base template
  image that can be later re-used to start similar VMs easily.
