## Overview

Achieving the core objective of the
[EGI Federation](https://www.egi.eu/egi-federation/) to advance research and
innovation, embracing
[Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), is possible by
empowering scientists and researchers to perform domain-specific research tasks,
without having to deal with the complexities of the underlying infrastructure.

An essential tool that contributes to this objective is a flexible development
environment, where users can create and share documents containing live code,
equations, narrative text, and rich media output.

The following development environments are available:

- [Notebooks](./notebooks) is a browser-based, scalable tool for interactive
  data analysis.
- [Replay](./replay) allows re-creation of custom computing environments for
  reproducible execution of notebooks.

Their dedicated sections offer a detailed description of each development
environment.
