  The default environment in EGI Notebooks

The default environment includes a set of
[kernels](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) that
are automatically built from the
[EGI-Federation/egi-notebooks-images](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/egi-notebooks-images)
GitHub repository. These are the ones available:

- Python: Default Python 3 kernel, it includes commonly used data analysis and
  machine learning libraries. Created from the
  [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-scipy-notebook)
  stack.

- DIRAC / Python 2: A python 2 kernel that includes a DIRAC installation for
  interacting with
  [EGI Workload Manager](../../../../compute/orchestration/workload-manager).

- Julia: The Julia programming language with the libraries described in
  [jupyter/datascience-notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook).

- R: The R programming language with several packages from the R ecosystem as
  provided by
  [jupyter/r-notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-r-notebook)
  and some extra libraries.

- Octave: The [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) programming
  language installed on its own conda environment (named `octave`).

If you want to add a new kernel, just let us know and we will discuss the best
way to support your request.
