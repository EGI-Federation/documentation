  Environments available in EGI Notebooks
---

Jupyter is an extensible environment that supports different programming
languages. For the EGI service we have enabled two different environments:

- the [default environment](./default) including commonly used languages like
  Python, R, and Julia.
- the [MATLAB environment](./matlab), for running MATLAB.

Additionally, you can bring your own environment via [Binder](../../binder).
This will allow you to build reproducible and shareable environments for your
notebooks.

After logging into the service, you will be shown a form for selecting the
environment, pick the desired one and click start
