  Introduction to using EGI Cloud services
---

## Overview

EGI is a federation of computing and storage resource providers
united by a mission to support research and innovation.

The resources in the EGI Cloud are offered by
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) [service providers](https://www.egi.eu/federation/egi-federated-cloud/)
that either run their own [data centers](https://www.egi.eu/federation/data-centres/)
or rely on community, private and/or public cloud services.
Most services in the EGI Cloud are based on [OpenStack](openstack) deployments.

On top of the resources in the EGI Cloud, a multitude of academic
communities (clouds) were created, each with their own virtualised resources
built around open standards. The development of these academic/researsh clouds
is driven by requirements of the scientific community.

## Access to unused resources

Users in the EGI Cloud may gain opportunistic usage to unused resources.
These are resources that are not dedicated to the user's organization, but are
accessible when the research center(s) have some spare resources.
This enables the most efficient use of resources.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Users should not reply on (unused)
resources not dedicated to their organisations, as access can be lost without
warning, and data may be lost if not properly backed up.
