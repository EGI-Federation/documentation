  How to to use the EGI infrastructure with Pangeo
---

EGI and the Pangeo community in Europe have forged
[a collaboration](https://www.egi.eu/case-study/pangeo/)
to provide deployments of the Pangeo ecosystem using the computing
resources offered by the European Open Science Cloud
([EOSC](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/)). Read on to learn more about
how to get involved.

## About the Pangeo community in Europe

Many scientific domains have been transformed into data-driven disciplines.
Research projects increasingly and crucially depend on the exchange and
processing of data and have developed platforms tailored to their needs.
[Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/), a world-wide community driven platform initially
developed for Geoscience, has a huge potential to become a common gateway able
to leverage a wide variety of infrastructures and data providers for various
science fields.

Public pangeo deployments that are providing fast access to large amounts of
data and compute resources are all USA-based and members from the Pangeo
community in Europe do not have a shared platform where scientists or
technologists can exchange know-how. The main objective of this collaboration
with EGI is to demonstrate how to deploy and use Pangeo on EOSC and underlined
the benefits for the European community.

## How to get involved

EGI and the Pangeo community in Europe are interacting openly via a GitHub
repository: [pangeo-eosc](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-eosc/). Visit
this repository to find publications coming out of this collaboration and
guides on how to get started
[as a user](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-eosc/blob/main/users/users-getting-started.md)
or [as a provider](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-eosc/blob/main/providers/providers-getting-started.md).
