  The task force behind the EGI Federation
---

## What is it?

The EGI Federated Cloud (FedCloud) Task Force gathers together scientific
communities, R&D projects, and technology and resource providers so they can
design the tools and services that support the federation of providers,
share best practices, and offer user support and training in a
collaborative fashion. This enables community cloud solutions to develop
faster, with a lower cost, and with a more sustainable future.

## Objectives

The task force members:

- **Capture requirements** from user communities needing federated cloud
  services.
- **Identify, integrate and enhance open source tools and services** that
  enable cloud federations for research and education.
- **Develop and maintain tools and services** to fill gaps in third-party
  solutions to reach production quality cloud federations.
- **Provide consultancy** for communities on how to build a federated cloud
  that meets custom community demands.
- **Provide training and support** for existing and potential users of cloud
  federations about topics such as:
  - How to port existing applications to the cloud, or develop cloud-native
    applications
  - How to operate services in the cloud
  - How to join a cloud federation as a provider
- **Facilitate the reuse of tools and services** across participating cloud
  federations to lower total cost of development and to improve cloud
  sustainability.
- **Promote Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**
  environments that are proven to be robust and reusable, to communities that
  interact with federated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers in the
  EGI infrastructure.
- **Provide service management and security oversight** for participating
  clouds and cloud federations.
- **Act as a discussion forum** where cloud federations can be discussed and
  specific questions can be analysed with experts.
- **Organise dissemination and marketing events**, such as workshops and
  conferences relating to the topics of the collaboration.
