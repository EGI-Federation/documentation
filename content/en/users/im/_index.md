  Using Infrastructure Manager on EGI Cloud
---

[Infrastructure Manager](https://www.grycap.upv.es/im) is a tool that
streamlines the access and the usability of IaaS clouds by automating the
configuration, deployment, and monitoring of [Virtual Appliances](../vmi).

It supports APIs from a large number of _Cloud Management Frameworks (CMFs)_
making user applications cloud-agnostic. In addition it integrates a
contextualization system to enable the installation and configuration of user
specific applications.

It is a service that features a web-based GUI, a XML-RPC API, a REST API and a
command-line interface. For detailed information about Infrastructure Manager
please visit its [documentation pages](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io).

IM is integrated with the [EGI Check-in Service](../check-in). A very easy
way to deploy your first Virtual Machine in the EGI Federation is using the
[web-based GUI](https://appsgrycap.i3m.upv.es:31443/im-dashboard/). Please see
[a tutorial](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard.html#usage) or
[a demo video](https://youtu.be/vmtzGOZxiUg).

Infrastructure Manager was presented in one of the
[EGI Webinars](https://www.egi.eu/webinars/). See more details on the
[indico page](https://indico.egi.eu/event/5495/) and the video recording
available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Q9VsYjI1mD4). See more demos and
videos at the [YouTube IM reproduction list](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgPH186Qwh_37AMhEruhVKZSfoYpHkrUp).
