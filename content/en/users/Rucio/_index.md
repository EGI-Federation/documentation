## Overview

Built on more than a decade of experience in LHC experiments, Rucio serves the
data needs of any modern scientific experiments. Rucio can manage large amounts
of data, countless numbers of files, heterogeneous storage systems, globally
distributed data centres, monitoring and analytics.

Rucio allows you to manage your data with expressive statements. You to say what
you want, and let Rucio figure out the details of how to do it. For example,
Three copies of my file on different continents with a backup on tape. You can
also automatically remove copies of data after a set period or once its access
popularity drops.

While Rucio is extremely scalable, the STFC Rucio Data Management Service is
designed for smaller communities, with expected data needs up to tens of
Petabytes. The fact that the underlying Rucio infrastructure is managed by STFC,
allows communities to easily start using and or test Rucio with little setup
cost required.
