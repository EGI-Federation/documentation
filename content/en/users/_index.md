## Request for information

You can ask for more information about the services at:
[here](https://www.egi.eu/more-information/)

## Accessing EGI services

You can access EGI services from:

- [EGI Service Catalogue](https://www.egi.eu/services/)

Depending on the access conditions, a service (or an instance of the service)
may be open for any user, OR it may require requesting access (Ordering). The
EGI Website together with the connected EGI Marketplace streamlines the process.

## Access conditions

EGI services use the following types of access conditions:

- Wide access: Users can freely access the service. Login may be required but
  it's possible with various institutional accounts (through EduGAIN) or with a
  social IDs (e.g. Google). Example: the
  [open instance of the EGI Notebooks](https://notebooks.egi.eu/)
- Policy based: Users are granted access based on specific policies defined by
  the service providers. Access needs to be requested, and will be checked for
  such services. Example: Compute resources and tools allocated to researchers
  in medical imaging ([Biomed VO](http://lsgc.org/biomed.html)).
- Pay-for-use: Services are provided for a fee. Example:
  [FitSM In-house course](https://www.egi.eu/services/fitsm-training/in-house-training/)

The EGI user community support team handles access requests (orders) for the
'Policy based' and 'Pay-for-use' access modes. They will respond to the request
within maximum 5 work days. We normally contact you to have a short
teleconference meeting to better understand your requirements so we will be able
to identify resources and services that best match your needs. The meeting
typically covers two topics:

- What is the background of your request? (scientific domain, partners
  countries, user bases, pay-for-use or not, etc.).
- What are the technical details of your use case? (how much CPU cores, RAM per
  CPU, software services, how long do you need, etc.)

## Capacity allocation

Service access is based on **Virtual Organisations (VOs)**. A Virtual
Organisation is a group of users and the service providers from the federation
who allocate capacity for a specific user group. Users are not individually
enabled in the services but through VOs.

VOs are fully managed by communities allowing them to manage their users and
grant control access to the services and resources. Usually there is one-to-one
mapping between research communities and Virtual Organizations (although this is
not mandatory). Users can also belong to different VOs, e.g. they work with
different communities. Fine-grained authorisation mechanisms can be enabled
within a VOs, for example only a subset of the users of a given VO may have
access rights to manage software applications for that VO.

If we are able to support your case, then there are two options to support you:

1. We grant you access to an existing service, for example to compute resource
   pools (Virtual Organisations) that already exist in EGI for specific
   scientific disciplines or for researchers in specific regions. (You can
   browse these in the
   [EGI Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/). If there is a
   suitable VO then we help you join it and use its services.

1. If none of the existing resource pools are suitable for your use case, then
   we create a new VO for your community. The procedure is as follows:
   - We will contact our provider and negotiate resources for you.
   - If there are providers happy to support you, we will sign a Service Level
     Agreement (SLA) with you
   - A new VO will be created for your community
