## Ordering EGI services

You can order EGI services from:

* [EGI marketplace](https://marketplace.egi.eu/), or
* [EOSC marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services?providers=1)

### Payments Model

The payment models of EGI services can be:
* Sponsored use for policy-based access
* [Pay-as-you-go](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/VT_EGI_Pay-for-Use_Service/Price_Overview)
  for market-based access

### What happens after you place an order

EGI user support team will handle your order within 5 working days.

We normally contact you to have a short virtual meeting in order to better
understand your requirements:
* What is your research project background (science domain, partners countries,
  user bases, pay-for-use or not, etc.). These will help us identify better
  resources matching your needs.
* What is your requirements details (how much CPU cores, RAM per CPU,
  software services, how long do you need, etc. )

If we are able to support your case, there will be two options:

1. We will try to map you to an existing EGI community VO. Domain specific and
   regional VOs can be browsed at [Operation Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/).
   If there is a suitable one, we will contact the VO managers to join you to
   the VO and grant you the access to the resources attached to that VO.

1. If there are no suitable VOs existing, we need to create a new VO for your
   community. The procedure is as follows:
   * We will contact our provider and negotiate resources for you.
   * If there are providers happy to support you, we will sign SLA with you
   * A new VO will be created for your community
