## Request for information

You can ask for more information about the services at: [here](https://www.egi.eu/more-information/)

## Accessing EGI services

You can access EGI services from:

* https://www.egi.eu/services/ 

Depending on the access conditions, a service (or an instance of the service) may be open
for any user, OR it may require requesting access (Ordering). The EGI Website together with
the connected EGI Marketplace streamlines the process.  

### Access conditions

EGI services use the following types of access conditions:
- Wide access: Users can freely access the service. Login may be required but it's possible
   with various institutional accounts (through EduGAIN) or with a social IDs (e.g. Google). 
   Example: the [open instance of the EGI Notebooks](https://notebooks.egi.eu/)
*  Policy based: Users are granted access based on specific policies defined by the service providers. Access needs to be requested, and will be checked for such services. Example: [Compute resources and tools allocated to researchers in medical imaging (Biomed VO)](http://lsgc.org/biomed.html).
* Pay-for-use: Services are provided for a fee. Example: [FitSM In-house course](https://www.egi.eu/services/fitsm-training/in-house-training/) 

The EGI user community support team handles access requests (orders) for the 'Policy 
based' and 'Pay-for-use' access modes. They will respond to the request within maximum
5 work days. We normally contact you to have a short teleconference meeting to better
understand your requirements so we will be able to identify resources and services
that best match your needs. The meeting typically covers two topics:
* What is the background of your request? (scientific domain, partners countries, user bases, pay-for-use or not, etc.). 
- What are the technical details of your use case? (how much CPU cores, RAM per CPU, 
   software services, how long do you need, etc.)

### Capacity allocation

If we are able to support your case, then there are two options to support you: 
1. We grant you access to an existing service, for example to compute resource pools
    (called Virtual Organisations - VOs) that already exist in EGI for specific scientific 
    disciplines or for researchers in specific regions. (You can browse these in the 
    [EGI Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/). If there is a suitable 
    VO then we help you join it and use its services. 

1. If none of the existing resource pools are suitable for your use case, then we create a
   new VO for your community. The procedure is as follows:
   * We will contact our provider and negotiate resources for you.
   - If there are providers happy to support you, we will sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with you
   * A new VO will be created for your community
