## Linking new identities to your EGI Account

Identity linking allows you to access EGI resources with your existing personal
EGI ID, using any of the login credentials you have linked to your account. You
can use any of your organisational or social login credentials for this purpose.
To link a new organisational or social identity to your EGI account:

1. Enter the following URL in a browser: <https://aai.egi.eu/registry>

1. Click **Login** and authenticate using any of the login credentials _already_
   linked to your EGI account

1. Navigate to **My EGI User Community Account** page in one of the following
   ways:

   - hover over your display name next to the gear icon on the top right corner
     of the page; _or, alternatively,_
   - select **EGI User Community** from the list of available Collaborations and
     then click **My EGI User Community Account** from the **People** menu

1. You will need to sign in using the login credentials from the
   institutional/social identity provider you want to link to your account.

   {{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}} It is very important to escape
   the identity provider selection, cached in the discovery page, before picking
   the new one. {{% /alert %}}

1. After successful authentication, the new Identity Provider will be available
   under the Organizational Identities tab and you'll be able to access EGI
   resources with your existing personal EGI ID using the login credentials of
   the identity provider you selected in **Step 6**.
