  Using Infrastructure Manager to orchestrate VM deployment in the EGI Cloud
---

[Infrastructure Manager](https://www.grycap.upv.es/im) is a tool that
streamlines the access and the usability of IaaS clouds by automating the
configuration, deployment, and monitoring of Virtual Appliances.

IM orchestrates the deployment of custom virtual infrastructures on multiple
back-ends. It automates the deployment, configuration, software installation,
monitoring and update of virtual infrastructures. It supports a wide variety
of back-ends, either public (such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or
Microsoft Azure), on-premises (such as OpenStack) or federated infrastructures
(such as [EGI Cloud Compute](../cloud-compute)), thus making user applications
cloud agnostic.

It is a service that features a web-based GUI, a XML-RPC API, a REST API and a
command-line interface. For detailed information about Infrastructure Manager
please visit its [documentation pages](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io).

IM is integrated with the [EGI Check-in Service](../check-in). A very easy
way to deploy your first Virtual Machine in the EGI Federation is using the
[web-based GUI](https://appsgrycap.i3m.upv.es:31443/im-dashboard/). Please see
[a tutorial](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard.html#usage) or
[a demo video](https://youtu.be/vmtzGOZxiUg).

Infrastructure Manager was presented in one of the
[EGI Webinars](https://www.egi.eu/webinars/). See more details on the
[indico page](https://indico.egi.eu/event/5495/) and the video recording
available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Q9VsYjI1mD4). See more demos and
videos at the [YouTube IM reproduction list](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgPH186Qwh_37AMhEruhVKZSfoYpHkrUp).
