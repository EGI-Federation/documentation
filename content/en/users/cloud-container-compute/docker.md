  Run containers on the EGI Cloud on a single VM with Docker

The
[EGI Docker VA](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vappliance/egi.docker.ubuntu.16.04)
is a ready-to-use Virtual Machine Image with [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) pre-installed.

You can start that image as any other VA available from AppDB:

1. Go to the
   [EGI Docker image entry in AppDB](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vappliance/egi.docker.ubuntu.16.04).

1. Check the identifiers of the endpoint, image and flavor you want to use at
   the provider.

1. Use a ssh key when, so you can log into the VM once it\'s instantiated.

1. Once up, just ssh in the VM and start using docker as usual.

### Using docker from inside the VM

You can log in with user `ubuntu` and your ssh key:

```shell
ssh -i <yourprivatekey> ubuntu@<your VM ip>
```

Once in, you can run any docker command, e.g.:

```shell
ubuntu@fedcloud_vm:~$ sudo docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Docker-compose can be also used to execute applications with more than one
container running together,
