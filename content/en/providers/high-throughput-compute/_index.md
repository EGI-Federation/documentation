With High-Throughput Compute you can run computational jobs at scale on the EGI
infrastructure. It allows you to analyse large datasets and execute thousands of
parallel computing tasks.

High-Throughput Compute is provided by a distributed network of computing
centres, accessible via a standard interface and membership of a virtual
organisation. EGI offers more than 1,000,000 cores of installed capacity,
supporting over 1.6 million computing jobs per day.

This service supports research and innovation at all scales: from individuals to
large collaborations.

Main characteristics of the service:

- Access to high-quality computing resources
- Integrated monitoring and accounting tools to provide information about the
  availability and resource consumption
- Workload and data management tools to manage all computational tasks
- Large amounts of processing capacity over long periods of time
- Faster results for your research
- Shared resources among users, enabling collaborative research
