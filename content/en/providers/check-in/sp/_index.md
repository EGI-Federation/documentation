This page contains information about connecting services to
[Check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/) in order to allow user login
through Check-in and to receive users' attributes.

## Services eligible for integration

EGI Operations, as owner of the Check-in service, must approve every request for
integration of new services with the AAI proxy. The approval (or non-approval)
will be based on some pre-requisites, the relevance of the service for the EGI
community and the available resources to support the integration. The
pre-requisites are described in the following sections.

**EGI at any time can prevent a service provider to access the Check-in
service**

### Services federated in EGI

All the services that are operated by Resource Providers federated in EGI
federation and that abide to the RC OLA, and consequently to the relevant
security policies of EGI, can be SP for the EGI Check-in service. Fulfilling all
the relevant EGI policies makes the service eligible in receiving attributes
released by the Check-in proxy.

### Services not federated in EGI

A service not part of the EGI federation can be integrated as a SP in the
Check-in AAI Proxy if the organisation providing the service complies with the
EGI security requirements relevant to the service providers.

**To assert compliance, the organisation needs to fill in the
[registration form for SPs](https://documents.egi.eu/document/3086). A PDF scan
of a printed and signed copy should be sent to `operations_at_egi.eu`.**

By accepting the policies a service provider assures that they will operate the
service in good faith, without deliberately exposing the user to security risks,
without claiming intellectual property on the data owned by the user, and
protecting sensitive data generated by the interaction of the user with the
service.

The policies that the service provider will have to accept are available in this
page
[EGI Policies and procedures page](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Policies_and_Procedures)
and specifically are:

1. [e-Infrastructure Security Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/3015)
1. [Service Operations Security Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/3601)
1. [Traceability and Logging Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/81)
1. [Security Incident Response Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/82)
1. [Policy on the Processing of Personal Data](https://documents.egi.eu/document/2732)

## Service Provider integration workflow

To integrate your Service Provider with the EGI Check-in service, you need to
[open a GGUS ticket](https://ggus.eu/?mode=ticket_submit) indicating your
request. The responsible support unit is
[Check-in (AAI) Support](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS:AAI_SUPPORT_FAQ). The
integration follows a two-step process:

1. Register your Service Provider and test integration with the **demo**
   instance of EGI Check-in. The demo instance allows for testing authentication
   and authorisation without affecting the production Check-in service. Note
   that while the demo instance has identical functionality to the production
   instance, no information is shared between the two systems.
   - You can also test new features of Check-in that are not available in
     production yet, by registering your Service Provider and testing
     integration with the **development** instance of Check-in. As with the demo
     instance, the development instance allows for testing authentication and
     authorisation without affecting the production Check-in service. **NB: the
     list of supported Identity Providers in the development instance is
     limited. Therefore, we recommend using the EGI SSO or any of the social
     identity providers to test the login workflow when using the development
     instance.**
1. Register your Service Provider with the **production** instance of EGI
   Check-in to allow members of the EGI User Community to access your service.
   This requires that your service meets all the
   [eligibility criteria](#Services_eligible_for_integration "wikilink") and
   that integration has been thoroughly tested during Step 1.

The most important URLs for each environment are listed in the table below but
more information can be found in the protocol-specific sections that follow.

## SAML Service Provider

To enable federated access to a web-based application, you can connect to the
EGI Check-in IdP as a SAML Service Provider (SP). Users of the application will
be redirected to Check-in in order to log in, and Check-in can authenticate them
using any of the supported backend authentication mechanisms, such as
institutional IdPs registered with eduGAIN or Social Providers. Once the user is
authenticated, EGI Check-in will return a SAML assertion to the application
containing information about the authenticated user.

### Metadata registration

SAML authentication relies on the use of metadata. Both parties (you as a SP and
the EGI Check-in IdP) need to exchange metadata in order to know and trust each
other. The metadata include information such as the location of the service
endpoints that need to be invoked, as well as the certificates that will be used
to sign SAML messages. The format of the exchanged metadata should be based on
the XML-based
[SAML 2.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf).
Usually, you will not need to manually create such an XML document, as this is
automatically generated by all major SAML 2.0 SP software solutions (e.g.,
Shibboleth, SimpleSAMLphp, and `mod_auth_mellon`). It is important that you
serve your metadata over HTTPS using a browser-friendly SSL certificate, i.e.
issued by a trusted certificate authority.

You can get the metadata of the EGI Check-in IdP Proxy on a dedicated URL that
depends on the integration environment being used:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Metadata

Metadata provided by your SP should contain a descriptive name of the service
that your SP represents in at least English. It is recommended to also provide
the name in other languages which are commonly used in the geographic scope of
the deployment. The name should be placed in the `<md:ServiceName>` in the
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` container.

It is recommended that the `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element included in your SP
metadata contains both an `AuthnRequestsSigned` and an `WantAssertionsSigned`
attribute set to `true`.

Your SP metadata should also contain contact information for support and for a
technical contact. The `<md:EntityDescriptor>` element should contain both a
`<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `"support"` and a
`<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `"technical"`. The
`<md:ContactPerson>` elements should contain at least one `<md:EmailAddress>`.
The support address may be used for generic support questions about the service,
while the technical contact may be contacted regarding technical
interoperability problems. The technical contact must be responsible for the
technical operation of the service represented by your SP.

### Attributes

The EGI Check-in IdP is guaranteed to release a minimal subset of the
[REFEDS R&S](https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship) attribute
bundle to connected Service Providers without administrative involvement,
subject to user consent. The following attributes constitute a minimal subset of
the R&S attribute bundle:

- Persistent, non-reassignable, non-targeted, opaque, globally unique EGI user
  ID (`eduPersonUniqueId`); this is always scoped `@egi.eu`
- Email address (`mail`)
- Display name (`displayName`) OR (`givenName` AND `sn`)

A more extensive list of all the attributes that may be made available to
Service Providers is included in the [User Attribute](#user-attributes) section.

### Attribute-based authorisation

EGI Check-in provides information about the authenticated user that may be used
by Service Providers in order to control user access to resources. This
information is provided by the EGI Check-in IdP in the
[SAML attribute assertion](#attributes). The table below lists the SAML
attributes that are relevant for user authorisation:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Description                                                                                     | SAML Attribute         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [VO/group membership/roles of the authenticated user](#vogroup-membership-and-role-information) | `eduPersonEntitlement` |
| [Level of Assurance (LoA)](#level-of-assurance)                                                 | `eduPersonAssurance`   |

## OpenID Connect Service Provider

Service Providers can be integrated with EGI Check-in using OpenID Connect
(OIDC) as an alternative to the SAML2 protocol. To allow this, the EGI Check-in
IdP provides an OpenID Connect (OAuth2) API based on
[MITREid Connect](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server),
which has been
[certified by the OpenID Foundation](http://openid.net/certification/).
Interconnection with the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider allows users to sign in
using any of the supported backend authentication mechanisms, such as
institutional IdPs registered with eduGAIN or Social Providers. Once the user
has signed in, EGI Check-in can return OIDC Claims containing information about
the authenticated user.

### Client registration

Before your service can use the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider for user login, you
must set up a client at <https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/manage/#admin/clients> in
order to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials and register one or more redirect URIs.

#### Obtaining OAuth 2.0 credentials

You need OAuth 2.0 credentials, including a client ID and client secret, to
authenticate users through the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider.

You can specify the client ID and secret when creating/editing your client or
let the [New Client page](https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/manage/user/client/new)
generate the values for you (_recommended_).

To find the ID and secret of your client, do the following:

1. Select your client from the
   [Clients page](https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/manage/user/clients).
1. Look for the **Client ID** in the **Main** tab.
1. Select the **Display/edit client secret:** option from the **Credentials**
   tab.

#### Setting one or more Redirection URIs

The Redirection URI(s) that you set when creating/editing your client determine
where the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider sends responses to your authentication
requests. Note that the Redirection URI MUST use the `https` scheme; the use of
`http` Redirection URIs is only allowed in the development environment.

To find the Redirection URI(s) for your client, do the following:

1. Open the [Clients page](https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/manage/user/clients)
2. Find the redirect URIs for your client listed under the **Information**
   column of the overview table or **Edit** the particular client and look for
   the **Redirect URI(s)** in the **Main** tab.

#### Setting additional information about the client

It is strongly suggested that you add a short **description** and a **logo** for
the client. Lastly, you need to set the email addresses of one or more contacts.

### Claims

The EGI Check-in UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that
returns specific information about the authenticated End-User as Claim Values.
To obtain the requested Claims about the End-User, the Client makes a request to
the UserInfo Endpoint using an Access Token obtained through OpenID Connect
Authentication. The scopes associated with the Access Token used to access the
EGI Check-in UserInfo Endpoint will determine what Claims will be released.
These Claims are represented by a JSON object that contains a collection of name
and value pairs for the Claims.

The following scope values can be used to request Claims from the EGI Check-in
UserInfo Endpoint:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length no-inline-html -->
| Scope                          | Claims                                                                                                                       |

| `eduperson_entitlement`        | `eduperson_entitlement`                                                                                                      |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length no-inline-html -->

A more extensive list of all the attributes that may be made available to
Service Providers is included in the [User Attribute](#user-attributes) section.

### Grant Types

Check-in supports the following OpenID Connect/OAuth2 grant types:

- Authorization Code: used by Web Apps executing on a server.
- Implicit: used by JavaScript-centric apps (Single Page Applications) executing
  on the user\'s browser.
- Token Exchange: used by clients to request and obtain security tokens in
  support of delegated access to resources.
- Device Code: used by devices that lack a browser to perform a user-agent based
  OAuth flow.

### Endpoints

The most important OIDC/OAuth2 endpoints are listed below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

#### Authorization Endpoint

The Authorization Endpoint performs Authentication of the End-User. This is done
by sending the User Agent to the Authorization Server\'s Authorization Endpoint
for Authentication and Authorization, using request parameters defined by OAuth
2.0 and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID Connect.

The request parameters of the Authorization endpoint are:

- `client_id`: id of the client that ask for authentication to the Authorization
  Server.
- `redirect_uri`: URI to which the response will be sent.
- `scope`: A list of attributes that the application requires.
- `state`: Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the
  callback.
- `response_type`: value that determines the authorization processing flow to be
  used.

1. For **Authorization Code** grant set `response_type=code`. This way the
   response will include an authorization code.
1. For **Implicit** grant set `response_type=token`. This way the response will
   include both an Access Token and an ID Token.

#### Token Endpoint

To obtain an Access Token, an ID Token, and optionally a Refresh Token, the
Client sends a Token Request to the Token Endpoint.

Depending on the grant type, the following parameters are required:

##### Authorization Code

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Parameter      | Presence | Values                                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`   | Required | `authorization_code`                                                                               |
| `code`         | Required | The value of the code in the response from authorization endpoint.                                 |
| `redirect_uri` | Required | URI to which the response will be sent (must be the same as the request to authorization endpoint) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

##### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie) extension
([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) describes a technique for
public clients (clients without `client_secret`) to mitigate the threat of
having the authorization code intercepted. The technique involves the client
first creating a secret, and then using that secret again when exchanging the
authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it
will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret.

###### Client configuration

To enable PKCE you need to <https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc> and create/edit a
client. In "Credentials" tab under "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" select
"No authentication" and in "Crypto" tab under "Proof Key for Code Exchange
(PKCE) Code Challenge Method" select "SHA-256 hash algorithm".

###### Protocol Flow

Because the PKCE-enhanced Authorization Code Flow builds upon the standard
Authorization Code Flow, the steps are very similar.

First, the client creates and records a secret named the `code_verifier`. The
`code_verifier` is a high-entropy cryptographic random STRING using the
unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "\_" / "~", with a
minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. Then the
client creates a `code_challenge` derived from the `code_verifier` by using one
of the following transformations on the code verifier:

- `plain` code_challenge = code_verifier
- `S256` code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))

If the client is capable of using `S256`, it MUST use `S256`. Clients are
permitted to use `plain` only if they cannot support `S256` for some technical
reason.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} There are various tools that generate
these values such as <https://tonyxu-io.github.io/pkce-generator/>
{{% /alert %}}

Then the `code_challenge` is sent in the Authorization Request along with the
transformation method (`code_challenge_method`).

####### Example request

```sh
GET https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/authorize?
      client_id=${client_id}
      &scope=openid%20profile%20email
      &redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
      &response_type=code
      &code_challenge=${code_challenge}
      &code_challenge_method=S256"
```

The Authorization Endpoint responds as usual but records `code_challenge` and
the `code_challenge_method`.

####### Example response

```sh
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: ${redirect_uri}?
    code=fgtLHT
```

The client then sends the authorization code in the Access Token Request as
usual but includes the `code_verifier` secret generated in the first request.

####### Example request

```sh
curl -X POST "https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/token" \
-d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
-d "code=${code}" \
-d "client_id=${client_id}" \
-d "redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}" \
-d "code_verifier=${code_verifier}" | python -m json.tool
```

The authorization server transforms `code_verifier` and compares it to
`code_challenge` from the first request. Access is denied if they are not equal.

##### Device Code

The device code flow enables OAuth clients on (input-constrained) devices to
obtain user authorization for accessing protected resources without using an
on-device user-agent, provided that they have an Internet connection.

1. **Device Authorization Request**

   The client initiates the authorization flow by requesting a set of
   verification codes from the authorization server by making an HTTP "POST"
    request to the device authorization endpoint. The client constructs the
    request with the following parameters:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
   | Parameter   | Presence | Values                                                                                                    |
   | ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `client_id` | Required | The identifier of the client                                                                              |
   | `scope`     | Optional | Define one or more scopes that are contained in the original token; otherwise all scopes will be selected |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

###### Example request

   ```sh
   curl -X POST "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/devicecode" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "client_id={myClientID}" \
       -d "&scope=openid%20email%20profile" | python -m json.tool
   ```

###### Example response

   ```json
   {

     "user_code": "IEJSJB",
     "verification_uri": "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/device)"
   }
   ```

1. **User Interaction**

   After receiving a successful Authorization Response, the client displays or
   otherwise communicates the `user_code` and the `verification_uri` to the end
   user and instructs them to visit the URI in a user agent on a secondary
   device (for example, in a browser on their mobile phone), and enter the
   user code.

2. **Device Access Token Request**

   After displaying instructions to the user, the client makes an Access Token
   Request to the token endpoint. The request contains the following parameters:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
   | Parameter       | Presence | Values                                                                                                    |

### Claims-based authorisation

EGI Check-in provides information about the authenticated user that may be used
by Service Providers in order to control user access to resources. This
information is provided by the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider in the form of
[OIDC claims](#claims). The table below lists the claims that are relevant for
user authorisation:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Description                                                                                     | OIDC Claim                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [VO/group membership/roles of the authenticated user](#vogroup-membership-and-role-information) | `edu_person_entitlements` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Example OIDC Client

In this guide we will demonstrate how to install and configure a
[simple OIDC client](https://github.com/rciam/simple-oidc-client).

#### Install simple-oidc-client

This guide assumes the Apache HTTP server has been installed and the document
root is `/var/www/html`

Move to the apache document root and download and extract
[simple-oidc-client.zip](https://github.com/rciam/simple-oidc-client/releases/download/v1.0.0/simple-oidc-client.zip).

#### Configure Client

Go to this link and login <https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/>

Then create a new client or edit your existing client. In `main` tab enter a
`Client name` and in the `Redirect URI(s)` insert your simple-oidc-client URL
(e.g. <https://example.com/simple-oidc-client/popup.html>). This URL must link
to popup.html which is located in simple-oidc-client directory.  
Next, move to `access` tab and pick the `scopes` your service needs. Then, in
`Grant types` check `authorization code` and `implicit`. In `Response Types`
check `code` and `token id_token`.  
Then, click save and copy your `Client ID`.

#### Configure simple-oidc-client

Now that we have everything we need, we can configure our login settings. Go to
your terminal and open `configuration.js` with your favorite text editor. ex.

```sh
vi simple-oidc-client/configuration.js
```

Let's go quickly through the settings:

- `title` is the title on the navigation bar.
- `authority` is the base URL of our IdentityServer instance. This will allow
  oidc-client to query the metadata endpoint so it can validate the tokens.
- `client_id` is the id of the client we want to use when hitting the
  authorization endpoint.
- `popup_redirect_uri` is the redirect URL used when using the signinPopup
  method. If you prefer not having a popup and redirecting the user in the main
  window, you can use the `redirect_uri` property and the signinRedirect method.
- `post_logout_redirect_uri` is the redirect URL used when using the
  signoutRedirect method.
- `response_type` defines in our case that we only expect an identity token
  back.
- `scope` defines the scopes the application asks for.
- `debug` displays user data.
- `filterProtocolClaims` indicates to oidc-client if it has to filter some OIDC
  protocol claims from the response: `nonce`, `at_hash`, `iat`, `nbf`, `exp`,
  `aud`, `iss` and `idp`.

You must change the followings options based on your client configuration:

- `authority` (issuer)
- `client_id`
- `scope`

An example configuration follows:

```javascript
var settings = {
  title: "Simple OIDC Client",
  authority: "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc",
  client_id: "client",
  popup_redirect_uri: "https://example.com/simple-oidc-client/popup.html",
  post_logout_redirect_uri: "https://example.com/simple-oidc-client/index.html",

  response_type: "token id_token",
  scope:
    "openid profile email" /* add offline_access to obtain a refresh token*/,

  debug: false,
  filterProtocolClaims: false,
};
```

## Integrating Science Gateways with RCauth for obtaining (proxy) certificates

In order for Science Gateways (VO portals) to obtain RFC proxy certificates
derived from **personal** end-entity certificates, an EGI Science Gateway can
make use of the IGTF-approved IOTA-type RCauth.eu online CA. The actual
integration goes via an intermediary service, called a Master Portal. EGI is
running two Master Portal instances, one development, one production instance.

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Registering a client at the Master Portal

In order to register a new client for your VO portal go to:

- EGI Development instance:
  <https://masterportal-pilot.aai.egi.eu/mp-oa2-server/register>
- EGI Production instance: <https://aai.egi.eu/mp-oa2-server/register>

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Make sure to store the `client_id` and
`client_secret` in a secure place {{% /alert %}}

In order to get the client approved, send an email to the adminstrator of the
EGI Master Portal using
[EGI Check-in support](mailto:egi-aai-checkin@lists.grnet.gr).

#### Detailed information

For further and detailed instructions on the integration flow, see the generic
[RCAuth.eu MasterPortal VOPortal integration guide](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/RCauth.eu_and_MasterPortal_VOPortal_integration_guide)

#### SSH key authentication for proxy retrieval

The EGI MasterPortal also allows users to authenticate using _SSH key pair_, in
order to retrieve proxy certificates from the MasterPortal. Users need to first
upload the public key via a self-service portal, <https://aai.egi.eu/sshkeys/>.
About once a week they need to follow a web-flow to ensure a long-lived proxy
certificate is present in MasterPortal, e.g. by going to
<https://aai.egi.eu/vo-portal/>. They can then obtain a proxy certificate by
doing

```sh
ssh proxy@ssh.aai.egi.eu
```

and storing the output in `/tmp/x509up_u$(id -u)`

Generic information for users on how to do this can be found at
[Instructions for end-users on how to use the SSH key authN for proxy retrieval](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/RCauth.eu_and_MasterPortal_SSH_Key_Portal).
Alternatively VO portals could implement such functionality themselves by using
the API described at the
[Master Portal sshkey endpoint description](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/Master_Portal_sshkey_endpoint).

## User authorisation

The following information about the authenticated user can be provided by EGI
Check-in in order to control user access to resources:

1. VO/group membership and role information about the authenticated user
1. Level of Assurance (LoA)

### VO/group membership and role information

#### Background

VO/group membership and role information is encoded in entitlements
(`eduPersonEntitlement` attribute values in SAML or `edu_person_entitlements`
claim in OIDC). These entitlements are typically used to indicate access rights
to protected resources. Entitlements are multi-valued, with each value formatted
as a URN.

#### Syntax

An entitlement value expressing group membership and role information has the
following syntax (components enclosed in square brackets are OPTIONAL):

```vim
urn:mace:egi.eu:group:<GROUP>[:<SUBGROUP>*][:role=<ROLE>]#<GROUP-AUTHORITY>
```

where:

- `<GROUP>` is the name of a VO, research collaboration or a top level arbitrary
  group. `<GROUP>` names are unique within the `urn:mace:egi.eu:group`
  namespace;
- zero or more `<SUBGROUP>` components represent the hierarchy of subgroups in
  the `<GROUP>`; specifying sub-groups is optional
- the optional `<ROLE>` component is scoped to the rightmost (sub)group; if no
  group information is specified, the role applies to the VO
- `<GROUP-AUTHORITY>` is a non-empty string that indicates the authoritative
  source for the entitlement value. For example, it can be the FQDN of the group
  management system that is responsible for the identified group membership
  information

**Example:**

```vim
urn:mace:egi.eu:group:fedcloud.egi.eu:role=vm_operator#aai.egi.eu
```

#### Old Syntax (will be deprecated in a next release)

An entitlement value expressing group membership and role information has the
following syntax (components enclosed in square brackets are OPTIONAL):

```vim
urn:mace:egi.eu:<GROUP-AUTHORITY>:[<GROUP>[:<SUBGROUP>:…]]:<ROLE>@<VO>
```

**Example:**

```vim
urn:mace:egi.eu:aai.egi.eu:vm_operator@fedcloud.egi.eu
```

### Level of Assurance

Based on the authentication method selected by the user, the EGI proxy assigns a
Level of Assurance (LoA), which is conveyed to the SP through both the
`eduPersonAssurance` attribute and the Authentication Context Class
(`AuthnContextClassRef`) of the SAML authentication response. EGI AAI currently
distinguishes between three LoA levels, similarly to the
[eID Assurance Framework (eIDAF)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_235_R_0002).
Each level is represented by a URI as follows:

- **Low**: Authentication through a social identity provider or other low
  identity assurance provider: `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#Low`
- **Substantial**: Password/X.509 authentication at the user\'s home IdP:
  `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#Substantial`
- **High**: Substantial + multi-factor authn (not yet supported, TBD):
  `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#High`

Some EGI SPs have been configured to provide limited access (or not to accept at
all) credentials with the Low LoA.

Note: When logging in through the EGI SSO IdP, the LoA is determined based on
the selected authentication mechanism as follows:

- Username/password credentials → Low
- X.509 certification → Substantial
