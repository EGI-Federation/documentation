This page contains information about connecting services to
[EGI Check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/) in order to allow user
login through Check-in and to receive users' attributes. Check-in is connected
to a wide range of academic and social Identity Providers that users can choose
from in order to access your service.

## Services eligible for integration

EGI Operations, as owner of the Check-in service, must approve every request for
integration of new services with Check-in. The approval (or non-approval) is
based on some prerequisites, the relevance of the service for the EGI community
and the available resources to support the integration. The prerequisites are
described in the following sections.

**EGI at any time can prevent a service provider to access the Check-in
service**

### Services federated in EGI

All the services that are operated by Resource Providers federated in EGI
federation and that abide to the RC OLA, and consequently to the relevant
security policies of EGI, can be connected with Check-in. Fulfilling all the
relevant EGI policies makes the service eligible in receiving attributes
released by Check-in.

### Services not federated in EGI

A service not part of the EGI federation can be integrated with Check-in if the
organisation providing the service complies with the EGI security requirements
relevant to the service providers.

By accepting the policies a service provider assures that they will operate the
service in good faith, without deliberately exposing the user to security risks,
without claiming intellectual property on the data owned by the user, and
protecting sensitive data generated by the interaction of the user with the
service.

The policies that the service provider will have to accept are available in the
[EGI Policies and procedures page](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Policies_and_Procedures)
and specifically are:

1. [EGI Security Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/3015)
1. [Service Operations Security Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/3601)
1. [Traceability and Logging Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/2934)
1. [Security Incident Response Policy](https://documents.egi.eu/document/2935)
1. [Policy on the Processing of Personal Data](https://documents.egi.eu/document/2732)

## Service Provider integration workflow

To integrate your Service Provider with the EGI Check-in service, you need to
create a registration request using the
[EGI Federation Registry Portal](https://aai.egi.eu/federation). You can also
use the Federation Registry portal to request the reconfiguration or
deregistration of an existing deployed service. Service registration requests
typically require approval by an administrator. Please refer to the
[Federation Registry Documentation](https://federation.rciam.grnet.gr/docs) for
more information.

The integration follows a two-step process:

1. Register your Service Provider and test integration with the **demo**
   instance of EGI Check-in by selecting the "Demo" integration environment
   during registration through the EGI Federation Registry Portal. The demo
   instance allows for testing authentication and authorisation through the
   academic and social Identity Providers connected to Check-in without
   affecting the production Check-in service. Note that while the demo instance
   has identical functionality to the production instance, no information is
   shared between the two systems.
   - You can also test new features of Check-in that are not available in
     production yet, by registering your Service Provider and testing
     integration with the **development** instance of Check-in. In the
     development instance service requests can be self-reviewed without the need
     to wait for approval from an administrator. As with the demo instance, the
     development instance allows for testing authentication and authorisation
     without affecting the production Check-in service. **NB: the list of
     supported Identity Providers in the development instance is limited.
     Therefore, we recommend using any of the social identity providers or the
     [EGI SSO](https://sso.egi.eu/admin/) to test the login workflow when using
     the development instance.**
1. Register your Service Provider with the **production** instance of EGI
   Check-in by selecting the "Production" integration environment during
   registration through the EGI Federation Registry Portal. The production
   instance allows access to your service through the academic and social
   Identity Providers connected to Check-in. This requires that your service
   meets all the
   [eligibility criteria](#Services_eligible_for_integration "wikilink") and
   that integration has been thoroughly tested during Step 1.

The most important URLs for each environment are listed in the table below but
more information can be found in the protocol-specific sections that follow.

## General Information

EGI Check-in supports two authentication and authorisation protocols that you
can choose from:

1. [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html)
1. [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) - an
   extension to [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

Regardless of which of the two protocols you are going to use, you need to
provide the following information to connect your service to EGI Check-in:

1. Name of the service (in English and optionally in other languages supported
   by the service)
1. Short description of the service
1. Website (URL) for localised information about the service; the content found
   at the URL SHOULD provide more complete information than what provided by the
   description
1. Contact information of the following types:
   - Helpdesk/Support contact information (for redirecting user)
   - Administrative
   - Technical
   - Security/incident response
1. Privacy statement URL: The privacy policy is used to document the data
   collected and processed by the service. You can use the
   [Privacy Policy template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZU7VjH3g7qcfWcz0Z8TTv-vQiVoRA_wOsuMyJaz28Og/edit)
1. Logo URL (optional for showing in catalogues); if provided, logos SHOULD:
   - use a transparent background where appropriate to facilitate the usage of
     logos within a user interface
   - use PNG, or GIF (less preferred), images
   - use HTTPS URLs in order to avoid mixed-content warnings within browsers
   - have a size larger than 40000 and smaller than 50000 characters when
     encoded in base64
1. Country of the service
1. Compliance with the
   [EGI Policies](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Policies_and_Procedures) and the
   [GÉANT Data Protection Code of Conduct](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/CODE/Data+Protection+Code+of+Conduct+Home)

## SAML Service Provider

To enable federated access to a web-based application, you can connect to the
EGI Check-in IdP as a SAML Service Provider (SP). Users of the application will
be redirected to Check-in in order to log in, and Check-in can authenticate them
using any of the supported backend authentication mechanisms, such as
institutional IdPs registered with eduGAIN or Social Providers. Once the user is
authenticated, EGI Check-in will return a SAML assertion to the application
containing information about the authenticated user.

### Metadata registration

SAML authentication relies on the use of metadata. Both parties (you as a SP and
the EGI Check-in IdP) need to exchange metadata in order to know and trust each
other. The metadata include information such as the location of the service
endpoints that need to be invoked, as well as the certificates that will be used
to sign SAML messages. The format of the exchanged metadata should be based on
the XML-based
[SAML 2.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf).
Usually, you will not need to manually create such an XML document, as this is
automatically generated by all major SAML 2.0 SP software solutions (e.g.,
Shibboleth, SimpleSAMLphp, and `mod_auth_mellon`). It is important that you
serve your metadata over HTTPS using a browser-friendly SSL certificate, i.e.
issued by a trusted certificate authority.

You can get the metadata of the EGI Check-in IdP Proxy on a dedicated URL that
depends on the integration environment being used:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Development environment                               | Demo environment                                       | Production environment                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| <https://aai-dev.egi.eu/proxy/saml2/idp/metadata.php> | <https://aai-demo.egi.eu/proxy/saml2/idp/metadata.php> | <https://aai.egi.eu/proxy/saml2/idp/metadata.php> |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

To register your SAML SP, you must submit a service registration request at
[Federation Registry](https://aai.egi.eu/federation). Your request should
include the general information about your service (see
[General Information](#general-information)) and the SP's metadata and entity
id.

### Metadata

Metadata provided by your SP should contain a descriptive name of the service
that your SP represents in at least English. It is recommended to also provide
the name in other languages which are commonly used in the geographic scope of
the deployment. The name should be placed in the `<md:ServiceName>` in the
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` container.

It is recommended that the `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` element included in your SP
metadata contains both an `AuthnRequestsSigned` and an `WantAssertionsSigned`
attribute set to `true`.

Your SP metadata should also contain contact information for support and for a
technical contact. The `<md:EntityDescriptor>` element should contain both a
`<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `"support"` and a
`<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `"technical"`. The
`<md:ContactPerson>` elements should contain at least one `<md:EmailAddress>`.
The support address may be used for generic support questions about the service,
while the technical contact may be contacted regarding technical
interoperability problems. The technical contact must be responsible for the
technical operation of the service represented by your SP.

### Attributes

The EGI Check-in IdP is guaranteed to release a minimal subset of the
[REFEDS R&S](https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship) attribute
bundle to connected Service Providers without administrative involvement,
subject to user consent. The following attributes constitute a minimal subset of
the R&S attribute bundle:

- Persistent, non-reassignable, non-targeted, opaque, globally unique EGI user
  ID (`eduPersonUniqueId`); this is always scoped `@egi.eu`
- Email address (`mail`)
- Display name (`displayName`) OR (`givenName` AND `sn`)

A more extensive list of all the attributes that may be made available to
Service Providers is included in the [User Attribute](#user-attributes) section.

### Attribute-based authorisation

EGI Check-in provides information about the authenticated user that may be used
by Service Providers in order to control user access to resources. This
information is provided by the EGI Check-in IdP in the
[SAML attribute assertion](#attributes). The table below lists the SAML
attributes that are relevant for user authorisation:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Description                                                                                     | SAML Attribute         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [VO/group membership/roles of the authenticated user](#vogroup-membership-and-role-information) | `eduPersonEntitlement` |
| [Capabilities](#capabilities)                                                                   | `eduPersonEntitlement` |
| [GOCDB roles](#gocdb-roles)                                                                     | `eduPersonEntitlement` |
| [Identity Assurance](#identity-assurance)                                                       | `eduPersonAssurance`   |

## OpenID Connect Service Provider

Service Providers can be integrated with EGI Check-in using OpenID Connect
(OIDC) as an alternative to the SAML2 protocol. To allow this, the EGI Check-in
IdP provides an OpenID Connect (OAuth2) API based on
[MITREid Connect](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server),
which has been
[certified by the OpenID Foundation](http://openid.net/certification/).
Interconnection with the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider allows users to sign in
using any of the supported backend authentication mechanisms, such as
institutional IdPs registered with eduGAIN or Social Providers. Once the user
has signed in, EGI Check-in can return OIDC Claims containing information about
the authenticated user.

### Client registration

Before your service can use the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider for user login, you
must submit a service registration request using
[Federation Registry](https://aai.egi.eu/federation) in order to obtain OAuth
2.0 credentials. The client configuration should include the general information
about your service, as described in [General Information](#general-information)
section.

#### Obtaining OAuth 2.0 credentials

You need OAuth 2.0 credentials, which typically include a client ID and client
secret, to authenticate users through the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider.

You can specify the client ID and secret when creating/editing your client or
let them being automatically generated during registration (_recommended_).

To find the ID and secret of your client, do the following:

1. Select your client from the
   [Manage Services Page](https://aai.egi.eu/federation).
1. Look for the **Client ID** in the **Protocol** tab.
1. Select the **Display/edit client secret:** option from the **Protocol** tab.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} You can copy these values using the
green copy button next to the desired field.{{% /alert %}}

#### Setting one or more Redirection URIs

The Redirection URI(s) that you set when creating/editing your client determine
where the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider sends responses to your authentication
requests. Note that the Redirection URI MUST use the `https` scheme; the use of
`http` Redirection URIs is only allowed in the development environment.

To find the Redirection URI(s) for your client, do the following:

1. Open the [Manage Services](https://aai.egi.eu/federation)
1. Find the redirect URIs for your client listed under the **Protocol** column
   of the overview table or **Edit** the particular client and look for the
   **Redirect URI(s)** in the **Protocol** tab.

#### Setting additional information about the client

It is strongly suggested that you add a short **description** and a **logo** for
the client. Lastly, you need to set the email addresses of one or more contacts.

### Claims

The EGI Check-in UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that
returns specific information about the authenticated End-User as Claim Values.
To obtain the requested Claims about the End-User, the Client makes a request to
the UserInfo Endpoint using an Access Token obtained through OpenID Connect
Authentication. The scopes associated with the Access Token used to access the
EGI Check-in UserInfo Endpoint will determine what Claims will be released.
These Claims are represented by a JSON object that contains a collection of name
and value pairs for the Claims.

The following scope values can be used to request Claims from the EGI Check-in
UserInfo Endpoint:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length no-inline-html -->

| Scope                          | Claims                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `openid`                       | `sub`                                                                                            |
| `profile`                      | <ul><li>`name`</li><li>`given_name`</li><li>`family_name`</li><li>`preferred_username`</li></ul> |
| `email`                        | <ul><li>`email`</li><li>`email_verified`</li><li>`voperson_verified_email`</li></ul>             |
| `eduperson_scoped_affiliation` | `eduperson_scoped_affiliation`                                                                   |
| `eduperson_entitlement`        | `eduperson_entitlement`                                                                          |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length no-inline-html -->

A more extensive list of all the attributes that may be made available to
Service Providers is included in the [User Attribute](#user-attributes) section.

### Grant Types

Check-in supports the following OpenID Connect/OAuth2 grant types:

- Authorization Code: used by Web Apps executing on a server.
- Token Exchange: used by clients to request and obtain security tokens in
  support of delegated access to resources.
- Device Code: used by devices that lack a browser to perform a user-agent based
  OAuth flow.

### Endpoints

The most important OIDC/OAuth2 endpoints are listed below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

#### Authorization Endpoint

The Authorization Endpoint performs Authentication of the End-User. This is done
by sending the User Agent to the Authorization Server\'s Authorization Endpoint
for Authentication and Authorization, using request parameters defined by OAuth
2.0 and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID Connect.

The request parameters of the Authorization endpoint are:

- `client_id`: id of the client that ask for authentication to the Authorization
  Server.
- `redirect_uri`: URI to which the response will be sent.
- `scope`: A list of attributes that the application requires.
- `state`: Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the
  callback.
- `response_type`: value that determines the authorization processing flow to be
  used. For **Authorization Code** grant set `response_type=code`. This way the
  response will include an authorization code.

#### Token Endpoint

To obtain an Access Token, an ID Token, and optionally a Refresh Token, the
Client sends a Token Request to the Token Endpoint.

Depending on the grant type, the following parameters are required:

##### Authorization Code

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Parameter      | Presence | Values                                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`   | Required | `authorization_code`                                                                               |
| `code`         | Required | The value of the code in the response from authorization endpoint.                                 |
| `redirect_uri` | Required | URI to which the response will be sent (must be the same as the request to authorization endpoint) |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

##### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie) extension
([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) describes a technique for
public clients (clients without `client_secret`) to mitigate the threat of
having the authorization code intercepted. The technique involves the client
first creating a secret, and then using that secret again when exchanging the
authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it
will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret.

###### Client configuration

To enable PKCE you need to go to the
[Manage Services Page](https://aai.egi.eu/federation) and create/edit a client.
In "Protocol" tab under "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" select "No
authentication" and in "Crypto" tab under "Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
Code Challenge Method" select "SHA-256 hash algorithm".

###### Protocol Flow

Because the PKCE-enhanced Authorization Code Flow builds upon the standard
Authorization Code Flow, the steps are very similar.

First, the client creates and records a secret named the `code_verifier`. The
`code_verifier` is a high-entropy cryptographic random STRING using the
unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "\_" / "~", with a
minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. Then the
client creates a `code_challenge` derived from the `code_verifier` by using one
of the following transformations on the code verifier:

- `plain` code_challenge = code_verifier
- `S256` code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))

If the client is capable of using `S256`, it MUST use `S256`. Clients are
permitted to use `plain` only if they cannot support `S256` for some technical
reason.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} There are various tools that generate
these values such as <https://tonyxu-io.github.io/pkce-generator/>
{{% /alert %}}

Then the `code_challenge` is sent in the Authorization Request along with the
transformation method (`code_challenge_method`).

Example request:

```shell
GET "${AUTHORISATION_ENDPOINT}?
      client_id=${CLIENT_ID}
      &scope=openid%20profile%20email
      &redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}
      &response_type=code
      &code_challenge=${CODE_CHALLENGE}
      &code_challenge_method=S256"
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} You can find the _Authorisation
Endpoint_ in the [Endpoints](#endpoints) table.{{% /alert %}}

The Authorization Endpoint responds as usual but records `code_challenge` and
the `code_challenge_method`.

Example response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: ${REDIRECT_URI}?
    code=fgtLHT
```

The client then sends the authorization code in the Access Token Request as
usual but includes the `code_verifier` secret generated in the first request.

Example request:

```shell
curl -X POST "${TOKEN_ENDPOINT}" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=${CODE}" \
  -d "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}" \
  -d "code_verifier=${CODE_VERIFIER}" | python -m json.tool
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} You can find the _Token Endpoint_ in the
[Endpoints](#endpoints) table.{{% /alert %}}

The authorization server transforms `code_verifier` and compares it to
`code_challenge` from the first request. Access is denied if they are not equal.

Example response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJvaWRjIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ...",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJvaWRjIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ...",
  "scope": "openid email profile",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

##### Refresh request

The following request allows obtaining an access token from a refresh token
using the `grant_type` value `refresh_token`:

| Parameter       | Presence | Values                                        |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`     | Required | The identifier of the client.                 |
| `client_secret` | Required | The secret value of the client.               |
| `grant_type`    | Required | `refresh_token`                               |
| `refresh_token` | Required | `The value of the refresh token`              |
| `scope`         | Required | This parameter should contain openid at least |

Example request:

```shell
curl -X POST "${TOKEN_ENDPOINT}" \
  -u "${CLIENT_ID}":"${CLIENT_SECRET}" \
  -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
  -d "refresh_token=${REFRESH_TOKEN}" \
  -d "scope=openid%20email%20profile" | python -m json.tool;
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} You can find the _Token Endpoint_ in the
[Endpoints](#endpoints) table.{{% /alert %}}

Example response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJvaWRjIiwiYWx...",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJvaWRjIiwiYW...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJub25...",
  "scope": "openid profile email",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

###### Refresh Request with PKCE

To combine the refresh token grant type with PKCE you need to make the following
request:

```shell
curl -X POST "${TOKEN_ENDPOINT}" \
  -d "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
  -d "refresh_token=${REFRESH_TOKEN}" \

##### Device Code

The device code flow enables OAuth clients on (input-constrained) devices to
obtain user authorization for accessing protected resources without using an
on-device user-agent, provided that they have an Internet connection.

###### 1. Device Authorization Request

The client initiates the authorization flow by requesting a set of
verification codes from the authorization server by making an HTTP "POST"
request to the device authorization endpoint. The client constructs the request
with the following parameters:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Parameter   | Presence | Values                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id` | Required | The identifier of the client                                                                              |
| `scope`     | Optional | Define one or more scopes that are contained in the original token; otherwise all scopes will be selected |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Example request:

```shell
curl -X POST "${DEVICE_CODE_ENDPOINT}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "scope=openid%20email%20profile" | python -m json.tool
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} You can find the _Device Code Endpoint_
in the [Endpoints](#endpoints) table.{{% /alert %}}

Example response:

```json

  "user_code": "IEJSJB",
  "verification_uri": "https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/device"
}
```

###### 2. User Interaction

After receiving a successful Authorization Response, the client displays or
otherwise communicates the `user_code` and the `verification_uri` to the end
user and instructs them to visit the URI in a user agent on a secondary
device (for example, in a browser on their mobile phone), and enter the
user code.

###### 3. Device Access Token Request

After displaying instructions to the user, the client makes an Access Token
Request to the token endpoint. The request contains the following parameters:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Parameter       | Presence | Values                                                                                                    |

### Claims-based authorisation

EGI Check-in provides information about the authenticated user that may be used
by Service Providers in order to control user access to resources. This
information is provided by the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider in the form of
[OIDC claims](#claims). The table below lists the claims that are relevant for
user authorisation:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Description                                                                                     | OIDC Claim              |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Example OIDC Client

In this guide we will demonstrate how to install and configure a
[Simple OIDC Client](https://github.com/rciam/simple-oidc-client-php).

#### Install simple-oidc-client-php

This guide assumes the Apache HTTP server has been installed and the document
root is `/var/www/html`

Move to the apache document root and download and extract
[simple-oidc-client-php-v2.0.0.zip](https://github.com/rciam/simple-oidc-client-php/releases/download/v2.0.0/simple-oidc-client-php-v2.0.0.zip).

#### Configure Client

Login to the [EGI Federation Registry](https://aai.egi.eu/federation)

Then create a new service or edit your existing service. In `General` tab fill
all the required fields. For `Integration Environment` select `Demo`. In
`Protocol Specific` tab select as Protocol the `OIDC Service` and then in the
`Redirect URI(s)` insert your simple-oidc-client-php URL (e.g.
`http://localhost/simple-oidc-client-php/refreshtoken.php`). This URL must link
to `refreshtoken.php` which is located in simple-oidc-client-php directory.
Next, in `Scope` select the scopes that your service needs. Then, submit the
form and and self approve it. Finally you should get a pair of `Client ID` and
`Client Secret`.

#### Configure simple-oidc-client-php

Now that you have everything you need, you can configure your login settings. Go
to your terminal and open `config.php` with your favorite text editor.

Example:

```shell
vi simple-oidc-client-php/config.php
```

Let's go quickly through the settings:

- `title` required, the title on the navigation bar
- `img` required, the source of the logo
- `scope_info` optional, a message that informs the user for the application
  requirements
- `issuer` required, the base URL of our IdentityServer instance. This will
  allow oidc-client to query the metadata endpoint so it can validate the tokens
- `client_id` required, the id of the client we want to use when hitting the
  authorization endpoint
- `client_secret` optional, a value the offers better security to the message
  flow
- `pkceCodeChallengeMethod` optional, a string that defines the code challenge
  method for PKCE. Choose between `plain` or `S256`.
- `redirect_url` required, the redirect URL where the client and the browser
  agree to send and receive correspondingly the code
- `scopesDefine` required, defines the scopes the client supports
- `refresh_token_note` optional, info for the refresh token
- `access_token_note` optional, info for the access token
- `manage_token_note` optional, message the informs the user where can manage
  his tokens
- `manageTokens` optional, URL of the manage tokens service
- `sessionName` required, define the name of the cookie session
- `sessionLifetime` required, define the duration of the session. This must be
  equal to the validity time of the access token.

You must change the followings options based on your Service configuration you
setup earlier:

- `issuer`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_url`
- `scopesDefine`
- `sessionName` (based on the installation path of the portal)

An example configuration follows:

```php
<?php
// index.php interface configuration
$title = "Generate Tokens";
$img = "https://clickhelp.co/images/feeds/blog/2016.05/keys.jpg";
$scope_info = "This service requires the following permissions for your account:";

// Client configuration
$issuer = "https://aai-demo.egi.eu/oidc/";
$client_id = "CHANGE_ME";
$client_secret = "CHANGE_ME";  // comment if you are using PKCE
// $pkceCodeChallengeMethod = "S256";   // uncomment to use PKCE
$redirect_url = "http://localhost/simple-oidc-client-php/refreshtoken.php";
// add scopes as keys and a friendly message of the scope as value
$scopesDefine = array(
    'openid' => 'log in using your identity',
    'email' => 'read your email address',
    'profile' => 'read your basic profile info',
);
// refreshtoken.php interface configuration
$refresh_token_note = "NOTE: New refresh tokens expire in 12 months.";
$access_token_note = "NOTE: New access tokens expire in 1 hour.";
$manage_token_note = "You can manage your refresh tokens in the following link: ";
$manageTokens = $issuer . "manage/user/services";
$sessionName = "simple-oidc-client-php";
$sessionLifetime = 60*60;  // must be equal to access token validation time in seconds
```

## Integrating Science Gateways with RCauth for obtaining (proxy) certificates

In order for Science Gateways (VO portals) to obtain RFC proxy certificates
derived from **personal** end-entity certificates, an EGI Science Gateway can
make use of the IGTF-approved IOTA-type RCauth.eu online CA. The actual
integration goes via an intermediary service, called a Master Portal. EGI is
running two Master Portal instances, one development, one production instance.

### Registering a client at the Master Portal

In order to register a new client for your VO portal go to:

- EGI Development instance:
  <https://masterportal-pilot.aai.egi.eu/mp-oa2-server/register>
- EGI Production instance: <https://aai.egi.eu/mp-oa2-server/register>

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} Make sure to store the `client_id` and
`client_secret` in a secure place {{% /alert %}}

In order to get the client approved, send an email to the administrator of the
EGI Master Portal using
[EGI Check-in support](mailto:egi-aai-checkin@lists.grnet.gr).

#### Detailed information

For further and detailed instructions on the integration flow, see the generic
[RCAuth.eu MasterPortal VOPortal integration guide](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/RCauth.eu_and_MasterPortal_VOPortal_integration_guide)

#### SSH key authentication for proxy retrieval

The EGI MasterPortal also allows users to authenticate using _SSH key pair_, in
order to retrieve proxy certificates from the MasterPortal. Users need to first
upload the public key via a self-service portal, <https://aai.egi.eu/sshkeys/>.
About once a week they need to follow a web-flow to ensure a long-lived proxy
certificate is present in MasterPortal, e.g. by going to
<https://aai.egi.eu/vo-portal/>. They can then obtain a proxy certificate by
doing

```shell
ssh proxy@ssh.aai.egi.eu
```

and storing the output in `/tmp/x509up_u$(id -u)`

Generic information for users on how to do this can be found at
[Instructions for end-users on how to use the SSH key authN for proxy retrieval](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/RCauth.eu_and_MasterPortal_SSH_Key_Portal).
Alternatively VO portals could implement such functionality themselves by using
the API described at the
[Master Portal sshkey endpoint description](https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/Master_Portal_sshkey_endpoint).

## User attributes

This section defines the attributes that can be made available to services

## User authorisation

The following information about the authenticated user can be provided by EGI
Check-in in order to control user access to resources:

1. VO/group membership and role information about the authenticated user
1. Capabilities
1. Identity Assurance
1. GOCDB roles

### VO/group membership and role information

#### Background

VO/group membership and role information is encoded in entitlements
(`eduPersonEntitlement` attribute values in SAML or `eduperson_entitlement`
claim in OIDC). These entitlements are typically used to indicate access rights
to protected resources. Entitlements are multi-valued, with each value formatted
as a URN.

#### Syntax

An entitlement value expressing group membership and role information has the
following syntax (components enclosed in square brackets are OPTIONAL):

```text
urn:mace:egi.eu:group:<GROUP>[:<SUBGROUP>*][:role=<ROLE>]#<GROUP-AUTHORITY>
```

where:

- `<GROUP>` is the name of a VO, research collaboration or a top level arbitrary
  group. `<GROUP>` names are unique within the `urn:mace:egi.eu:group`
  namespace;
- zero or more `<SUBGROUP>` components represent the hierarchy of subgroups in
  the `<GROUP>`; specifying sub-groups is optional
- the optional `<ROLE>` component is scoped to the rightmost (sub)group; if no
  group information is specified, the role applies to the VO
- `<GROUP-AUTHORITY>` is a non-empty string that indicates the authoritative
  source for the entitlement value. For example, it can be the FQDN of the group
  management system that is responsible for the identified group membership
  information

**Example:**

```text
urn:mace:egi.eu:group:fedcloud.egi.eu:role=vm_operator#aai.egi.eu
```

### Capabilities

#### Background

The user's capability information is encoded in entitlements
(`eduPersonEntitlement` attribute values in SAML or `eduperson_entitlement`
claim in OIDC). These entitlements are typically used to indicate access rights
to protected resources. Entitlements are multi-valued, with each value formatted
as a URN following the syntax defined in
[AARC-G027](https://aarc-community.org/guidelines/aarc-g027/).

#### Syntax

An entitlement value expressing a capability has the following syntax
(components enclosed in square brackets are OPTIONAL):

```text
<NAMESPACE>:res:<RESOURCE>[:<CHILD-RESOURCE>]...[:act:<ACTION>[,<ACTION>]...]#<AUTHORITY>
```

where:

- `<NAMESPACE>` is controlled by the e-infrastructure, research infrastructure
  or research collaboration that manages the capability. The `<NAMESPACE>` of
  capabilities managed by Check-in is set to `urn:mace:egi.eu`, while,
  generally, it is in the form of
  `urn:<NID>:<DELEGATED-NAMESPACE>[:<SUBNAMESPACE>]...` where:

  - `<NID>` is the namespace identifier associated with a URN namespace
    registered with IANA2, ensuring global uniqueness. Implementers SHOULD use
    one of the existing registered URN namespaces, such as
    `urn:mace`[[MACE](https://incommon.org/community/mace-registries/mace-urn-registry/)].

  - `<DELEGATED-NAMESPACE>` is a URN sub-namespace delegated from one of the
    IANA registered NIDs to an organisation representing the e-infrastructure,
    research infrastructure or research collaboration. It is RECOMMENDED that a
    publicly accessible URN value registry for each delegated namespace be
    provided.

- The literal string `"res"` indicates that this is a resource-specific
  entitlement as opposed to, for example, an entitlement used for expressing
  group membership
  [AARC-G002](https://aarc-community.org/guidelines/aarc-g002/).

- `<RESOURCE>` is the name of the resource. Whether the name should be unique is
  an implementation decision.

- An optional list of colon-separated `<CHILD-RESOURCE>` components represents a
  specific branch of the hierarchy of resources under the identified
  `<RESOURCE>`.

- An optional list of comma-separated `<ACTION>`s MAY be included, which, if
  present, MUST be prefixed with the literal string “act”. This component MAY be
  used for further specifying the actions a user is entitled to do at a given
  resource. Note that the list of `<ACTION>`s is scoped to the rightmost
  child-resource; if no child-resource information is specified, actions apply
  to the top level resource. The interpretation of a capability without actions
  specified is an implementation detail.

- `<AUTHORITY>` is a mandatory and non-empty string that indicates the
  authoritative source of the capability. This SHOULD be used to further specify
  the exact issuing instance. For example, it MAY be the FQDN of the service
  that issued that specific capability. The `<AUTHORITY>` is specified in the
  f-component [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141) of the URN; thus,
  it is introduced by the number sign ("#") character and terminated by the end
  of the URN. All characters must be encoded according to
  [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141). Hence, the `<AUTHORITY>` MUST
  NOT be considered when determining equivalence (Section 3 in
  [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141)) of URN-formatted capabilities.
  The `<AUTHORITY>` of capabilities managed by Check-in is typically set to
  `aai.egi.eu`.

**Example:**

```text
urn:mace:egi.eu:res:rcauth#aai.egi.eu
```

### Identity Assurance

Based on the authentication method selected by the user, the EGI proxy assigns a
Identity Assurance, which is conveyed to the SP through both the
`eduPersonAssurance` attribute and the Authentication Context Class
(`AuthnContextClassRef`) of the SAML authentication response. EGI Check-in uses
Assurance Profiles which distinguish between three Identity Assurance levels,
similarly to the
[eID Assurance Framework (eIDAF)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_235_R_0002).
Each level is represented by a URI as follows:

- **Low**: Authentication through a social identity provider or other low
  identity assurance provider: `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#Low`
- **Substantial**: Password/X.509 authentication at the user\'s home IdP:
  `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#Substantial`
- **High**: Substantial + multi-factor authn (not yet supported, TBD):
  `https://aai.egi.eu/LoA#High`

Moreover, EGI Check-in follows the
[REFEDS Assurance framework (RAF)](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/ASS/REFEDS+Assurance+Framework+ver+1.0).
The EGI Check-in conveys any RAF values provided by the IdP directly to the SP,
through the aforementioned methods. Furthermore, Check-in will append into the
User's profile any additional LoA, if the user is eligible for it. For example,
a user having a Verified Email is eligible for the RAF value
`https://refeds.org/assurance/IAP/low`

Some EGI SPs have been configured to provide limited access (or not to accept at
all) credentials with the Low LoA.

Note: When logging in through the EGI SSO IdP, the LoA is determined based on
the selected authentication mechanism as follows:

- Username/password credentials → Low
- X.509 certification → Substantial

### GOCDB Roles

#### Background

GOCDB roles, as per
[GOCDB documentations](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB/PI/get_user_method), are
encoded (`eduPersonEntitlement` attribute values in SAML or
`eduperson_entitlement` claim in OIDC). These entitlements are typically used to
indicate access rights to protected resources. Entitlements are multi-valued,
with each value formatted as a URN.

#### Syntax

An entitlement value expressing GOCDB roles has the following syntax (components
enclosed in square brackets are OPTIONAL):

```text
urn:mace:egi.eu:goc.egi.eu:<PRIMARY_KEY>:<ON_ENTITY>:<USER_ROLE>@egi.eu
```

where:

- `<PRIMARY_KEY>` is the primary key for the user role, e.g. "123G0"
- `<ON_ENTITY>` is the name of the entity on which the user role applies to,
  e.g. "GRIDOPS-GOCDB"
- `<USER_ROLE>` is the user's role, e.g. "Site Operations Manager"

**Example:**

```text
urn:mace:egi.eu:goc.egi.eu:100453G0:GRIDOPS-CheckIn:Site+Administrator@egi.eu
```
