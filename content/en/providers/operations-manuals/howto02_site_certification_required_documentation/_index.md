Documents required for Resource Centre registration and certification.

The Resource Centre administrators should read and understand the first five
documents. It is a further requirement that the OLA between the NGI and RC, and
the Service Operations Policy are accepted by the Site Operations Manager.
Further, documents referred within the Service Operations Policy should also be
understood.
