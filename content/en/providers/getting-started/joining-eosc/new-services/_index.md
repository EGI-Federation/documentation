The EOSC Compute Platform is currently linked to the EGI Governance, and
services of the ECP are contributed by the EGI Council members. These
members can propose new services through the EGI Service Strategy, that
defines the overall direction to EGI services for a few-year time window.
The services are designed, validated through the EGI Community, with the
help of the EGI Services and Solutions Board (SSB).
