## Introduction

With the term “central” or “core service” we refer to a category of services in
the EOSC Compute Platform (like the service management tools) providing
capabilities that support the other services of the infrastructure and the related
activities. They are delivered through a single instance (with the fail-over and
high-availability mechanisms deemed necessary), and differently from services with
a distributed nature such as HTC, Cloud, and Storage, they cannot be ordered
through the Marketplace, but they become available as soon as a user joins the
infrastructure (e.g., the access to the EGI Helpdesk service).
