To become a provider of one of these services, you first have to become provider
of an EGI Foundation service within the
[federated resources](../federated-resource-provider) block. Once such a
foundational role is fulfilled you can configure/deploy the additional service
within your resource centre. This pre-requirement typically requires you to
become an EGI Cloud service provider, i.e. deploy OpenStack and federate it into
the [EGI Cloud Compute](../../../cloud-compute) service.
