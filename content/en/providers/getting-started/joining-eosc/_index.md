In these guidelines, we describe the set of actions a service provider should
follow to join the EOSC Compute platform, and to ensure the high-quality
delivery of service according to the EGI policies.

In particular, we consider here 5 cases:

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->

1. [Joining as a federated resource provider](../joining-eosc/federated-rp/_index.md).
   A provider (that we call Resource
   Centre) delivering one of the existing EGI Foundation services within the
   Federated Resource Providers layer: Cloud Compute, HTC Compute, Cloud
   Container Compute or Online Storage.
2. [Joining as a software provider](../joining-eosc/technology-provider/_index.md),
   also called Technology Providers, which are
   the maintainers of the middleware deployed on the ‘federated resource
   providers’ (previous point), enabling compute and storage services.
3. [Joining as a new provider](../joining-eosc/new-provider/_index.md)
   of an existing platform service in the Compute and Data Federation or the
   Platform services.
4. [Joining as Core/Central service provider](../joining-eosc/core-services/_index.md)
   within the Service Management Tool block: providers that support all the
   other services of the EOSC Compute Platform.
5. [Contributing a new service](../joining-eosc/new-services/_index.md) (i.e. not yet present) to the EOSC Compute
   platform (to the Federated Resource Providers, Compute and Data Federation,
   or the Platform services blocks).
