In these guidelines we describe the set of actions a service provider should follow
to join the EOSC Compute platform and to ensure the high-quality delivery of service
according to the EGI policies. In particular, we consider here 5 cases:
1. Joining as a federated resource provider. A provider (that we call Resource Centre)
delivering one of the existing EGI Foundation services within the Federated Resource
Providers layer: Cloud Compute, HTC Compute, Cloud Container Compute or Online Storage.
2. Joining as a software provider, also called Technology Providers, which are the
maintainers of the middleware deployed on the ‘federated resource providers’ (previous
point), enabling compute and storage services.
3. Joining as a new provider of the EGI Foundation services that are already included
in the Compute and Data Federation or the Platform services blocks (e.g. Workload
Manager, Notebooks, DataHub, …).
4. Joining as a new provider of an existing, non-EGI Foundation service of an existing
platform service (e.g. IM, EC3, DODAS, …) in the Compute and Data Federation or the
Platform services blocks.
5. Joining as Core/Central service provider within the Service Management Tool block:
providers that support all the other services of the EOSC Compute Platform.
Contributing a new (i.e. not yet present) service to the EOSC Compute platform (to the Federated Resource Providers, Compute and Data Federation, or the Platform services blocks).
