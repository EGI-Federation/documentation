In these guidelines, we describe the set of actions a service provider should
follow to join the [EGI Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/egi-infrastructure/),
and to ensure the high-quality delivery of service according to the EGI
policies.

Providers are offered with 5 options to become members in the EGI Federation and
deliver services for advanced computing within the EGI Infrastructure. The
options are documented below, linking to detailed instructions:

1. [Joining as a federated resource centre](../joining/federated-resource-center).
   A provider (that we call Resource Centre) delivering one of the following
   services: [Cloud Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-compute/),
   [HTC Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/high-throughput-compute/),
   [Cloud Container Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-container-compute/),
   or [Online Storage](https://www.egi.eu/service/online-storage/). More than
   200 Resource Centres have been integrated in this way.
2. [Joining as a software provider](../joining/technology-provider/), also
   called Technology Providers, which are the maintainers of the middleware
   deployed on the ‘federated resource providers’ (previous point).
3. [Joining as a new provider](../joining/new-provider/) of an existing platform
   service in the Compute and Data Federation or the Platform services, such as
   [DataHub](https://www.egi.eu/service/datahub/),
   [Notebooks](https://www.egi.eu/service/notebooks/),
   [Training Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/service/training-infrastructure/),
   and [Workload Manager](https://www.egi.eu/service/workload-manager/)
4. [Joining as Core/Central service provider](../joining/core-services/):
   providers of
   [services supporting all the other services of the EGI Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/services/federation/).
5. [Contributing a new service](../joining/new-services/) that is not yet
   present in the
   [EGI service portfolio](https://www.egi.eu/services/research/)and enables
   advanced computing in research and education.
