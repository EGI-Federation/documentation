To become a provider of one of these services, you first have to become provider
of an EGI Foundation service within the
[federated resources](../federated-resource-center) block. Once such a
foundational role is fulfilled you can configure/deploy the additional service
within your resource centre. This first step typically requires you to become an
EGI Cloud service provider, i.e. deploy OpenStack and federate it into the
[EGI Cloud Compute](../../../cloud-compute) service.
