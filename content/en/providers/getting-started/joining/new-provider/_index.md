To become a provider of one of the
[Services for Research](https://www.egi.eu/services/research/) already included
in the EGI Portfolio, you first have to become provider of a [federated resource
centre](../federated-resource-centre): as explained in the related page, this
first step typically requires you to become either an
[EGI HTC](../../../high-throughput-compute) provider by deploying Compute and
Storage capabilities, or a Cloud service provider, i.e. deploy OpenStack and
federate it into the [EGI Cloud Compute](../../../cloud-compute) service.

Once such a foundational role is fulfilled you can configure/deploy the
additional service within your resource centre.
