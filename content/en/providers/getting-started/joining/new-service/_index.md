The EGI services are contributed by the
[EGI Council members](https://www.egi.eu/egi-federation/#council), who can
propose new services through the
[EGI Service Strategy](https://www.egi.eu/publication/egi-federation-service-strategy-2022-2024/),
that defines the overall direction to EGI services for a few years time window.
The services are designed, validated through the EGI Community, with the help of
the [EGI Services and Solutions Board (SSB)](https://go.egi.eu/ssb).

The evolution of the services is driven by 5 Strategic Objectives (SO) which are
based on the knowledge of the user community needs that are being gathered
through research and innovation projects, customer interviews and analysis of
trends. Each defines an area for possible future work, and if approved, can be
developed into more concrete goals and intended results.

- SO1: Federated compute continuum
- SO2: Federated Data Lakes and repositories
- SO3: Data analytics and scientific tools including AI
- SO4: Professional support and consultancy
- SO5: Investigation of a trusted compute platform for sensitive data processing
