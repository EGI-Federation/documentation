To become a provider of one of the
[Services for Research](https://www.egi.eu/services/research/) already included
in the EGI Portfolio, you first have to become provider of a
[federated resource centre](../federated-resource-centre). This first step
typically requires you to become either an
[EGI High Throughput Compute (HTC)](../../high-throughput-compute) provider,
by deploying Compute and Storage capabilities, or a Cloud service provider, by
deploying OpenStack and federating it into the
[EGI Cloud Compute](../../cloud-compute) service.

Once such a foundational role is fulfilled you can configure/deploy the
additional service within your resource centre.
