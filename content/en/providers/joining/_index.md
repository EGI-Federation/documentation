In these guidelines, we describe the set of actions a service provider should
follow to join the [EGI Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/egi-infrastructure/),
and to ensure the high-quality delivery of service according to the EGI
policies.

Providers have different options to become members of the EGI Federation, and
deliver services for advanced computing within the EGI Infrastructure. The
options are documented below, linking to detailed instructions:

1. [Joining as a federated resource centre](../joining/federated-resource-centre),
   becoming a provider (that we call Resource Centre) delivering one of the
   following services:
   [Cloud Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-compute/),
   [HTC Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/high-throughput-compute/),
   [Cloud Container Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-container-compute/),
   or [Online Storage](https://www.egi.eu/service/online-storage/). More than
   200 Resource Centres have been integrated in this way.
2. [Joining as a software provider](../joining/technology-provider/), also
   called Technology Provider, which is providing middleware deployed on the
   [federated resource centres](./federated-resource-centre).
3. [Joining as a new provider](../joining/new-provider/) for an existing service
   in the Compute and Data Federation or the Platform services, such as
   [DataHub](https://www.egi.eu/service/datahub/),
   [Notebooks](https://www.egi.eu/service/notebooks/),
   [Training Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/service/training-infrastructure/),
   and [Workload Manager](https://www.egi.eu/service/workload-manager/)
4. [Joining as Core/Central service provider](../joining/core-service/) for
   [services supporting all the other services of the EGI Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/services/federation/).
5. [Contributing a new service](../joining/new-service/), enabling advanced
   computing in research and education, and not yet present in the
   [EGI service portfolio](https://www.egi.eu/services/research/).
