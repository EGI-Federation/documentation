  "Documentation for installation/configuration of OneProvider to join EGI
  DataHub spaces"

This documentation covers how to install and configure a OneData OneProvider in
order to join a new or existing DataHub space. In particular 2 types of
installations are available, depending if the provider wants to support the
space with an an empty storage or if existing data are willing to be exposed via
the OneProvider.

## Requirements for production installation

- Oneprovider
  - RAM: 32GB
  - CPU: 8 vCPU
  - Disk: 50GB SSD
  - To be adjusted for the dataset and usage scenario
- For high IOPS
  - High performance backend storage (CEPH)
  - Low latency network

## Installation and attach empty storage to the EGI DataHub

The installation of a new OneProvider is performed using the an installation
script used `onedatify` which will setup the components using Docker and
Docker-compose

The simple installation script can be generated from the EGI DataHub web
interface.

First you need to login to the EGI DataHub and from the Data menu you either
select an existing space or create a new one.

You can then select on the space menu the Providers section and click on the Add
Support button on the top right corner

You should then select on the page the tab: `Deploy your own provider` and there
you will have just to copy the command having already the correct parameters for
the OneZone to use (datahub.egi.eu) and the space to join.

### Run the command on the host

Paste the copied command in the terminal on the OneProvider machine (as
superuser).

If necessary, the Onedatify script will ask for permission to install all
necessary dependencies including Docker and Docker Compose.

After the dependency installation is complete, the script will ask several
questions and suggest default setting for each one:

The progress can be monitored on a separate terminal using the following
command:

`onedatify logs`

After the deployment is complete, the following message will be shown, with
connection details for administration panel for the Oneprovider instance:

The WebUI Admin portal at port 9443 can be used to administer the OneProvider
installation.

## Installation and expose existing data to the EGI DataHub

The installation of a new OneProvider to expose existing data sets to an EGI
DataHub space is similar to the installation with an empty storage.

When adding support to an existing or new space you should select from the EGI
DataHub GUI the tab : `Expose Existing dat set` and there you will have just to
copy the command having already the correct parameters for the OneZone to use
(datahub.egi.eu) and the space to join.

### Run the command on the host

Paste the copied command in the terminal on the OneProvider machine (as
superuser) and follow the instructions as for the case of an empty storage.

The only difference is that at the end of the installation and configuration
process the existing files will be automatically imported to the OneProvider.

You can monitor the import activity from the WebUI Admin panel at port 9443
