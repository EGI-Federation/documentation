Welcome to the home page of Service Providers. This section provides
documentation aimed at Service Providers across the EGI Federation.

Any service provider can join the EGI Federation and in doing so benefit from
being part of the major worldwide e-Infrastructure that is EGI. From a technical
point of view, the Federation may be joined by integrating your resources with
federation services such as [Check-in](./check-in), the EGI Federation Authentication and Authorisation
Infrastructure (AAI) service. This may be done at no cost, and resources can immediately
benefit from EGI federation services.

In order to make a difference in helping to define the strategic direction of
the EGI Federation and its federation services, countries or international
organisaionts can join the EGI Council. More details may be found
[on the EGI website](https://www.egi.eu/about/egi-council/joining-the-egi-council/).

See [the users section](../users) for User-centric documentation.
