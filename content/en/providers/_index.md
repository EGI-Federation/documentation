Welcome to the home page of Service Providers. This section provides
documentation aimed at Service Providers across the EGI Federation.

## Joining the EGI Infrastructure

Any service provider can join the EGI Federation and in doing so benefit from
being part of the major worldwide e-infrastructure that is
[EGI](https://www.egi.eu/egi-infrastructure/). From a technical point of view,
the Federation may be joined by integrating your resources with federation
services such as [Check-in](./check-in), the EGI Federation Authentication and
Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) service. This may be done at no cost, and
resources can immediately benefit from EGI federation services.

In order to make a difference in helping to define the strategic direction of
the EGI Federation and its federation services, countries or international
organisations can join the EGI Council. More details may be found
[on the EGI site](https://www.egi.eu/join-the-egi-federation/).

Providers have different options to become members of the EGI Federation, and
deliver high-quality services for advanced computing within the EGI
Infrastructure. The options are documented below, linking to detailed
instructions:

1. [Joining as a federated resource centre](./joining/federated-resource-centre),
   becoming a provider (that we call Resource Centre) delivering one of the
   following services:
   [Cloud Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-compute/),
   [HTC Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/high-throughput-compute/),
   [Cloud Container Compute](https://www.egi.eu/service/cloud-container-compute/),
   or [Online Storage](https://www.egi.eu/service/online-storage/). More than
   200 Resource Centres have been integrated in this way.
2. [Joining as a software provider](./joining/technology-provider/), also called
   Technology Provider, which is providing middleware deployed on the
   [federated resource centres](./joining/federated-resource-centre).
3. [Joining as a new provider](./joining/new-provider/) for an existing service
   in the Compute and Data Federation or the Platform services, such as
   [DataHub](https://www.egi.eu/service/datahub/),
   [Notebooks](https://www.egi.eu/service/notebooks/),
   [Training Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/service/training-infrastructure/),
   and [Workload Manager](https://www.egi.eu/service/workload-manager/)
4. [Joining as Core/Central service provider](./joining/core-service/) for
   [services supporting all the other services of the EGI Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/services/federation/).
5. [Contributing a new service](./joining/new-service/), enabling advanced
   computing in research and education, and not yet present in the
   [EGI service portfolio](https://www.egi.eu/services/research/).

## Integrating a service with EGI Check-in

1. If you are interested in **integrating your service with Check-in**, head to
   the [Check-in for service providers](./check-in/sp)!
2. If you are willing to **connect your Identity Providers** and allowing your
   users to access services via Check-in, look at the documentation for
   [Check-in for Identity Providers](./check-in/idp)!
