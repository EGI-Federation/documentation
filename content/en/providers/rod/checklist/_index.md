## Welcome on board!

Dear ROD member,

this page was created to help you start with ROD duties. We will show you
briefly what you should do to prepare yourself to act as a ROD.

First, in section "How to become a ROD member" we will describe steps which
needs to be taken before you start your work. In section "ROD duties" you will
find all the tasks that make up the ROD duties. Section "Important to read"
states a short introduction of all documents which concern this activity and
which you are supposed to read at the beginning. Under "Tools" section will be
described all tools used by ROD teams. Finally,  "Contact" section is going to
inform you how to contact others.

## How to become a ROD member

There are few actions which needs to be taken before you start your work:

1. Get a valid grid certificate delivered by certifiation authorities - this
   step is important because most of the tools used during the shift require
   certificate. [Find](http://www.eugridpma.org/members/worldmap/) EUGRIDPMA
   members.
2. [Register to Dteam VO](https://voms2.hellasgrid.gr:8443/voms/dteam/). Dteam
   membership will give you possibility to test sites and debug problems.
3. [Register into GGUS tool as support staff](https://docs.egi.eu/internal/helpdesk/account-and-privileges/#getting-supporter-privileges).
   GGUS is a ticketing system which is used for operational purpose within EGI.
   With support staff role you will be able to reply on and update recorded
   tickets.
4. [Register](https://goc.egi.eu/portal/index.php?Page_Type=Role_Requests) in
   GOCDB tool, a central database which contains all the information about EGI
   Infrastructure (sites and people). To be ROD members you have to be
   recoreded in this database. It will allows you to perform step 5.
5. Request the Regional Staff role in the GOC DB. Thanks to this role you will
   be recognized automatically in operations tools as ROD member. It gives you
   a several privilages in the database as well as in other tools.
6. Contact your NGI manager - you need to contact your NGI manager to be
   approved in GOC DB as Regional Staff and to be added to ROD mailing list in
   your NGI (this mailing list is a contact point to the whole ROD team within
   the NGI).
7. Get familiar with the [ROD documentation](../../rod), a single place where
   you will find all information relevant to your work as a ROD.
