## ROD intra-team communication

At the end of a shift the current ROD team should prepare the hand over for
internal ROD matters. Each ROD can decide independently on what the hand over
should look like and how it should be passed on to the next team. The following
list provides mere suggestions for what should be included:

- a list of tickets which will continue into the next week. Each item should
  contain the name of the site in question, EGI Helpdesk ticket number, an
  optional ROD ticket ID if your NGI uses an internal ticket system, and the
  current status of the ticket;
- any tickets opened that are not related to a particular alarm;
- a summary of problems encountered with core grid services;
- a report of any problems with operational tools that occurred during the
  shift;
- anything else the new team should be aware of.

For internal communication ROD can use mailing list(s), instant messengers, etc.
Each ROD team is free to choose how the internal communication is established.

## Communication with EGI Operations and site administrators

ROD should provide an email contact to where all ticket information should be
sent and register this address into the EGI Helpdesk. Another address (or
possibly the same) should be made available to make it possible for EGI
Operations, site administrators, or other bodies to contact them directly.

ROD should communicate with EGI Operations through the mailing list "operations
(AT) egi.eu". Urgent matters should be communicated via a Helpdesk ticket
assigned to the EGI Operations support unit to make tracking of the case
possible.

There is also the hand over section in the ROD dashboard which allows for EGI
Operations team and RODs to intercommunicate.
