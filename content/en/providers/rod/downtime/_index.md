## Downtime

To properly manage downtime it is important to highlight the differences between
the possible types of downtime. Downtime can't be added retroactively, and it is
always defined in UTC. The error messages when adding downtime are cryptic,
usually it's a parsing error in the time/date.

### Downtime classification

1. scheduled (e.g. for software/hardware upgrades) planned and agreed in
   advance. This needs to be announced at least 24h in advance.
2. unscheduled (e.g. power outages) unplanned, usually triggered by an
   unexpected failure.

### Downtime severities

1. WARNING (Resource will probably be working as normal, but may experience
   problems).
2. OUTAGE (Resource will be completely unavailable).

WARNING (formerly known as AT_RISK) implicates a type of severity that does not
have operational consequences. It is only an information for users that some
small temporary failures can appear. All failures during that time will be taken
into account in the reliability calculations. Examples include:

- Admins not present on site (conference, vacations).
- Reduced redundancy in network, power or cooling.
- Failed disk in RAID sets.

OUTAGE implicate that the site/node is completely unavailable and no tickets
should be created. This does not affect site metrics.

More information about downtimes can be found in the
[GOCDB User Documentation](https://docs.egi.eu/internal/configuration-database/downtimes/).

## Sites in downtime

When a ticket has been raised against a site that subsequently enters downtime,
the expiry date on the ticket can be extended.

When a ticket is open against a site that continues to add downtime the ticket
must be closed and the NGI requested to take action either by suspending or
un-certifying the site until such time that the problem is resolved. This
usually happens when a middleware upgrade is due or a bug in the middleware is
causing a site to fail. Sites then may choose to wait for the next middleware
release rather than spend effort trying to resolve the issue locally.

Sites that are in downtime will still have monitoring switched on and therefore
may appear to be failing tests. ROD must take care that when opening tickets to
ensure that they donâ€™t open tickets against sites in downtime.

If a site is in downtime for more than a month then it is advised that the site
should go to the uncertified state.

### Nodes in downtime

When a node of a site is in downtime alarms are generated but the Operations
Portal distinguishes these alarms, and marks the downtime accordingly in the
dashboard. ROD should not open tickets against nodes that are in downtime.

### Specific accounting test failure instructions

The APEL Nagios tests are not run against the site but query the central APEL
servers.

1. If there is more than one APEL failure for a given site, create a ticket for
   one of the alarms and mask all others by this one.
2. Edit the description of the ticket to state clearly that even though the
   failure is reported for a given CE, this is not a CE failure but a failure on
   the APEL service for the whole site.
3. Proceed with all sites in the same way. Please beware: APEL tests are not
   helped by scheduling downtime, the site admins need to get APEL publishing
   working again.

## Nodes not in production

When a node of a production site is declared as non-production in the GOCDB or
the node appears in BDII but is not declared in GOCDB then the ROD should do the
following:

- Recommend to the sites to take these nodes out of their site BDII
- If this is not a possibility then the site should set those nodes in downtime
  in GOCDB
- If the node is a test node and is in BDII but not in GOCDB then the sites
  should register it in GOCDB and turn monitoring off.
