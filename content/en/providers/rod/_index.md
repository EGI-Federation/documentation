## Introduction

ROD (Regional Operator on Duty) is a role which oversees the smooth operation of
EGI infrastructure in the respective NGI. ROD team is responsible for solving
problems on the infrastructure within own Operations Centre according to agreed
procedures. They ensure that problems are properly recorded and progress
according to specified timelines. They ensure that necessary information is
available to all parties. The team is provided by each Operations Centre and
requires procedural knowledge on the process. The role is usually covered by a
team of people and is provided by each NGI. Depending on how an NGI is organised
there might be a number of members in the ROD team who work on duty roster
(shifts on a daily or weekly basis), or there may be one person working as ROD
on a daily basis and a few deputies who take over the responsibilities when
necessary. This latter model is generally more suitable for small NGIs.

In this text, the acronym ROD will be used both for the whole team, or for the
person who is actually working on shift.

In order to become a ROD member, one first needs to go through the steps
described in the [Overview for ROD](./overview).

The following text describes the duties that ROD (teams) are responsible for.
