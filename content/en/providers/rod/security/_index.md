## Some procedures to deal with security events

Sites facing or suspecting a security incident on their resources have to
follow [Incident Handling Procedure](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/CSIRT+Incident+reporting)

New vulnerability issues of the middleware should be handled as defined in the
[related procedure](https://documents.egi.eu/public/ShowDocument?docid=3145)
with a guide what to do when
[you find a vulnerability](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/SVG).

Sites having critical vulnerabilities are handled according to [SEC03 EGI-CSIRT
Critical Vulnerability Handling Procedure](https://confluence.egi.eu/x/eB_xBg),
and if they do not respond properly, they may face suspension.
