  Integration of OpenStack providers
---

This manual provides information on how to set up a Resource Centre providing
cloud resources in the EGI infrastructure. Integration with FedCloud requires a
_working OpenStack installation_ as a pre-requirement. EGI supports any recent
[OpenStack version](http://releases.openstack.org) (tested from OpenStack Mitaka).

EGI expects the following OpenStack services to be available and accessible from
outside your site:

- Keystone
- Nova
- Cinder
- Glance
- Neutron
- Swift (if providing Object Storage)

FedCloud components are distributed through
[CMD (Cloud Middleware Distribution)](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_Cloud_Middleware_Distribution)
or docker container images available in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).
These docker containers come pre-packaged and ready to use in the EGI FedCloud
Appliance so you do not need to install any extra components on your site but
just run a VM and configure it approprietely to interact with your services.

The integration is performed by a set of EGI components that interact with the
OpenStack services APIs:

![image](openstacksite.png)

- Authentication of EGI users into your system is performed by configuring the
  native OpenID Connect support of Keystone. Support for legacy VOs using VOMS
  requires the installation of the **Keystone-VOMS Authorization plugin** to
  allow users with a valid VOMS proxy to obtain tokens to access your OpenStack
  deployment.
- **cASO** collects accounting data from OpenStack and uses **SSM** to send the
  records to the central accounting database on the EGI Accounting service
  ([APEL](https://apel.github.io/))
- **cloud-info-provider** registers the RC configuration and description through
  the [ARGO Messaging Service](https://argoeu.github.io/guides/messaging/) to
  facilitate service discovery
- **cloudkeeper** (and **cloudkeeper-os**) synchronises with
  [EGI AppDB](https://appdb.egi.eu/browse/cloud) so new or updated images can be
  provided by the RC to user communities (VO).

Not all EGI components need to share the same credentials. They are individually
configured, you can use different credentials and permissions if desired.

## Installation options

EGI distributes the integration components as:

- A Virtual Appliance (VA) that uses Docker containers to bundle all of the
  components in a single VM and just needs minor configuration to get started
- RPM and DEB Packages in the
  [CMD distribution](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_Cloud_Middleware_Distribution)

### FedCloud Virtual Appliance

The EGI FedCloud Appliance is available at
[AppDB](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vappliance/fedcloud.integration.appliance.openstack)
as an OVA file. You can easily extract the VMDK disk by untaring and optionally
converting it to your preferred format with qemu-img:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
# get image and extract VMDK
$ curl $(curl "https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vm/image/fc90d1aa-b0ae-46a0-b457-96f6f7a7d446:7875/json?strict" | jq -r .url) | \
    tar x "*.vmdk"
# convert to qcow2
$ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 FedCloud-Appliance.Ubuntu.*.vmdk fedcloud-appliance.qcow2
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

The appliance running at your OpenStack must:

- Have a host certificate to send the accounting information to the accounting
  repository. DN of the host certificate must be registered in GOCDB with
  service type `eu.egi.cloud.accounting`. The host certificate and key in PEM
  format are expected in `/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem` and
  `/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem` respectively.
- Have enough disk space for handling the VM image replication (\~ 100GB for
  `fedcloud.egi.eu` VO). By default these are stored at /image_data. You can
  mount a volume at that location.

### CMD Packages

The CMD-OS repository provides packages that have gone through a quality
assurance process for the supported distributions. Packages are available
via the [EGI repository](https://repository.egi.eu).

## Open Ports

The following **services** must be accessible to allow access to an
OpenStack-based FedCloud site (default ports listed below, can be adjusted to
your installation)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Port         | Application            | Note                                                             |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Outgoing ports

The EGI Cloud components require the following outgoing connections open:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Port          | Host                    | Note                                                            |

| **8443**/TCP  | `msg.argo.grnet.gr`     | AMS authentication (used to send accounting records by SSM).    |
| **443**/TCP   | `vmcaster.appdb.egi.eu` | AppDB image lists (used by cloudkeeper).                        |
| **8080**/TCP  | `cephrgw01.ifca.es`     | Swift server hosting EGI images (used by cloudkeeper).          |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Images listed in AppDB may be hosted in other servers besides
`cephrgw01.ifca.es`. Check the specific VO-wide image lists for details.

## Permissions

This is an overview of the expected account permissions used in an OpenStack
site, these accounts can be merged as needed for your deployment:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Component    | Permission                                                                                   |

| cloud-keeper | Permission to manage the images for all the projects supporting EGI VOs                      |
| Other users  | Automatically created by Keystone and permission set as configured in the mappings           |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

## EGI AAI

### OpenID Connect Support

The integration of OpenStack service providers into the EGI Check-in is a
two-step process:

1. Test integration with the development instance of EGI Check-in. This will
   allow you to check complete the complete functionality of the system without
   affecting the production Check-in service.
1. Once the integration is working correctly, register your provider with the
   production instance of EGI Check-in to allow members of the EGI User
   Community to access your service.

#### Registration into Check-in development instance

Before your service can use the EGI Check-in OIDC Provider for user login, you
must set up a client at the [EGI Check-in ODIC client management
page](https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/manage/user/clients) in order to obtain OAuth2.0
credentials and register one or more redirect URIs.

Make sure that you fill in the following options:

- _Main_ tab:

  > - Set redirect URL to
  >   `https://<your keystone endpoint>/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid/redirect`.
  >   Recent versions of OpenStack may deploy Keystone at `/identity/`, be sure
  >   to include that in the `<your keystone endpoint>` part of the URL if
  >   needed.

- _Access_ tab:

  > - Enable _openid_, _profile_, _email_, _eduperson_entitlement_ in the
  >   **Scope** field
  > - Enable _authorization code_ in the **Grant Types** field
  > - Enable _Allow calls to the Introspection Endpoint?_ in **Introspection**
  >   field

Once done, you will get a client id and client secret. Save them for the
following steps

#### Keystone setup

##### Pre-requisites

1. Keystone must run as a WSGI application behind an HTTP server (Apache is
   used in this documentation, but any server should be possible if it has
   OpenID connect/OAuth2.0 support). Keystone project has deprecated eventlet,
   so you should be already running Keystone in such way.
1. Keystone must be run with SSL
1. You need to install
   [mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc) for
   adding support for OpenID Connect to Apache.

{{% alert title="IGTF CAs" color="info" %}} EGI monitoring checks that your
Keystone accepts clients with certificates from the IGTF CAs. Please ensure that
your server is configured with the correct Certificate and Revocation path:

For Apache HTTPd

: HTTPd is able to use CAs and CRLs contained in a directory:

```ApacheConf
SSLCACertificatePath    /etc/grid-security/certificates
SSLCARevocationPath     /etc/grid-security/certificates
```

For haproxy

: CA and CRLS have to be bundled into one file.

  Client verification should be set as optional otherwise accepted CAs
  won\'t be presented to the EGI monitoring:

  <!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
  ```plaintext
  # crt: concatenated cert, key and CA
  # ca-file: all IGTF CAs, concatenated as one file
  # crl-file: all IGTF CRLs, concatenated as one file
  # verify: enable optional X.509 client authentication
  bind XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/host-cert-with-key-and-ca.pem ca-file /etc/haproxy/certs/igtf-cas-bundle.pem crl-file /etc/haproxy/certs/igtf-crls-bundle.pem verify optional
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

For nginx

: CA and CRLS have to be bundled into one file.

  Client verification should be set as optional otherwise accepted CAs
  won\'t be presented to the EGI monitoring:

  ```Nginx configuration file
  ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/igtf-cas-bundle.pem;
  ssl_crl /etc/ssl/certs/igtf-crls-bundle.pem;
  ssl_verify_client optional;
  ```

Managing IGTF CAs and CRLs

: IGTF CAs can be obtained from UMD, you can find repo files for your
  distribution at [EGI CA repository](https://repository.egi.eu/sw/production/cas/1/current/)

  IGTF CAs and CRLs can be bundled using the examples command
  hereafter.

  Please update CAs bundle after IGTF updates, and CRLs bundle after
  each CRLs update made by fetch-crl:

  ```shell
  cat /etc/grid-security/certificates/*.pem > /etc/haproxy/certs/igtf-cas-bundle.pem
  cat /etc/grid-security/certificates/*.r0 > /etc/haproxy/certs/igtf-crls-bundle.pem
  # Some CRLs files are not ending with a new line
  # Ensuring that CRLs markers are separated by a line feed
  perl -pe 's/----------/-----\n-----/' -i /etc/haproxy/certs/igtf-crls-bundle.pem
  ```

{{% /alert %}}

#### Apache Configuration

Include this configuration on the Apache config for the virtual host of your
Keystone service, using the client id and secret obtained above:

```ApacheConf
OIDCResponseType "code"
OIDCClaimPrefix "OIDC-"
OIDCClaimDelimiter ;
OIDCScope "openid profile email eduperson_entitlement"
OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDCClientID <client id>
OIDCClientSecret <client secret>
OIDCCryptoPassphrase <some crypto pass phrase>
OIDCRedirectURI https://<your keystone endpoint>/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid/redirect

# OAuth for CLI access
OIDCOAuthIntrospectionEndpoint https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/introspect
OIDCOAuthClientID <client id>
OIDCOAuthClientSecret <client secret>

# Increase Shm cache size for supporting long entitlements
OIDCCacheShmEntrySizeMax 65536

<Location ~ "/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid">
        AuthType openid-connect
        Require valid-user
</Location>

<Location ~ "/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/egi.eu/protocols/openid/auth">
        Authtype oauth20
        Require valid-user
</Location>
```

If you have multiple keystone hosts, configure an alternative caching mechanism
as per <https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/wiki/Caching>

For example, using memcache

```ApacheConf
OIDCCacheType memcache
OIDCMemCacheServers "memcache1 memcache2 memcache3"
```

Be sure to enable the mod_auth_oidc module in Apache, in Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo a2enmod auth_openidc
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}} If running Keystone behind a proxy, make
sure to correctly set the X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-Port request
headers, e.g. for haproxy:

```plaintext
http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto http if !{ ssl_fc }
http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Port %[dst_port]
```

{{% /alert %}}

#### Keystone Configuration

Configure your `keystone.conf` to include in the `[auth]` section `openid` in
the list of authentication methods:

```ini
[auth]

# This may change in your installation
# add openid to the list of the methods you support
methods = password, token, openid
```

Add a `[openid]` section as follows:

```ini
[openid]
# this is the attribute in the Keystone environment that will define the
# identity provider
remote_id_attribute = HTTP_OIDC_ISS
```

Add your horizon host as trusted dashboard to the `[federation]` section:

```ini
[federation]
trusted_dashboard = https://<your horizon>/dashboard/auth/websso/
```

Finally copy the default template for managing the tokens in horizon to
`/etc/keystone/sso_callback_template.html`. This template can be found in
keystone git repo at
`https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/etc/sso_callback_template.html`

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/keystone/master/etc/sso_callback_template.html \
    > /etc/keystone/sso_callback_template.html
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Now restart your Apache (and Keystone if running in uwsgi) so you can configure
the Keystone Federation support.

#### Keystone Federation Support

First, create a new `egi.eu` identity provider with remote id
`https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/`:

```shell
$ openstack identity provider create --remote-id https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/ egi.eu
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| Field       | Value                            |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| description | None                             |
| domain_id   | 1cac7817dafb4740a249cc9ca6b14ea5 |
| enabled     | True                             |
| id          | egi.eu                           |
| remote_ids  | https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/     |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
```

Create a group for users coming from EGI Check-in, usual configuration is to
have one group per VO you want to support.

```shell
$ openstack group create ops
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| Field       | Value                            |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| description |                                  |
| domain_id   | default                          |
| id          | 89cf5b6708354094942d9d16f0f29f8f |
| name        | ops                              |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
```

Add that group to the desired local project:

```shell
openstack role add member --group ops --project ops
```

Define a mapping of users from EGI Check-in to the group just created and
restrict with the `OIDC-eduperson_entitlement` the VOs you want to support for
that group. Substitute the group id and the allowed entitlements for the
adequate values for your deployment:

```shell
$ cat mapping.egi.json
[
    {
        "local": [
            {
                "user": {
            "name": "{0}"
        },
                "group": {
                    "id": "89cf5b6708354094942d9d16f0f29f8f"
                }
            }
        ],
        "remote": [
            {
                "type": "HTTP_OIDC_SUB"
            },
            {
                "type": "HTTP_OIDC_ISS",
                "any_one_of": [
                    "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "OIDC-eduperson_entitlement",
                "regex": true,
                "any_one_of": [
                    "^urn:mace:egi.eu:group:ops:role=vm_operator#aai.egi.eu$"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

More recent versions of Keystone allow for more elaborated mapping, but this
configuration should work for Mitaka and onwards

Create the mapping in Keystone:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ openstack mapping create --rules mapping.egi.json egi-mapping
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field | Value                                                                                                                            |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id    | egi-mapping                                                                                                                      |
| rules | [{u'remote': [{u'type': u'HTTP_OIDC_SUB'}, {u'type': u'HTTP_OIDC_ISS', u'any_one_of': [u'https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/']},        |
|       | {u'regex': True, u'type': u'OIDC-eduperson_entitlement', u'any_one_of': [u'^urn:mace:egi.eu:.*:ops:vm_operator@egi.eu$']}],      |
|       | u'local': [{u'group': {u'id': u'89cf5b6708354094942d9d16f0f29f8f'}, u'user': {u'name': u'{0}'}}]}]                               |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Finally, create the federated protocol with the identity provider and mapping
created before:

```shell
$ openstack federation protocol create \
            --identity-provider egi.eu \
            --mapping egi-mapping openid
+-------------------+-------------+
| Field             | Value       |
+-------------------+-------------+
| id                | openid      |
| identity_provider | egi.eu      |
| mapping           | egi-mapping |
+-------------------+-------------+
```

Keystone is now ready to accept EGI Check-in credentials.

#### Horizon Configuration

Edit your local_settings.py to include the following values:

```python
# Enables keystone web single-sign-on if set to True.
WEBSSO_ENABLED = True

# Allow users to choose between local Keystone credentials or login
# with EGI Check-in
WEBSSO_CHOICES = (
    ("credentials", _("Keystone Credentials")),
    ("openid", _("EGI Check-in")),
)
```

Once horizon is restarted you will be able to choose \"EGI Check-in\" for login.

#### CLI Access

The
[OpenStack Client](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-openstackclient/)
has built-in support for using OpenID Connect Access Tokens to authenticate. You
first need to get a valid token from EGI Check-in (e.g. from
<https://aai-dev.egi.eu/fedcloud/>) and then use it in a command like:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ openstack --os-auth-url https://<your keystone endpoint>/v3 \
            --os-auth-type v3oidcaccesstoken --os-protocol openid \
            --os-identity-provider egi.eu \
            --os-access-token <your access token> \
            token issue
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field   | Value                                                                                 |

+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

#### Additional VOs

Configuration can include as many mappings as needed in the json file. Users
will be members of all the groups matching the remote part of the mapping. For
example this file has 2 mappings, one for members of `ops` and another for
members of `fedcloud.egi.eu`:

```json
[
  {
    "local": [
      {
        "user": {
          "name": "{0}"
        },
        "group": {
          "id": "66df3a7a0c6248cba8b729de7b042639"
        }
      }
    ],
    "remote": [
      {
        "type": "HTTP_OIDC_SUB"
      },
      {
        "type": "HTTP_OIDC_ISS",
        "any_one_of": ["https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/"]
      },
      {
        "type": "OIDC-eduperson_entitlement",
        "regex": true,
        "any_one_of": [
          "^urn:mace:egi.eu:group:ops:role=vm_operator#aai.egi.eu$"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "local": [
      {
        "user": {
          "name": "{0}"

##### Multiple OIDC providers

If your OpenStack deployment needs to support multiple identity providers
(besides EGI Check-in) you will need to configure `mod_auth_openidc` to
support [multiple
providers](https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/wiki/Multiple-Providers#discovery)
and use an OAuth2.0 token introspection proxy like
[ESACO](https://github.com/indigo-iam/esaco).

##### `mod_auth_openidc` configuration

First, create a directory to host each of the providers configuration, in our
case we will use `/var/lib/apache2/oidc/metadata`, but adapt this to your
specific needs. Ensure this directory is writable by the user running apache:

```shell
mkdir -p /var/lib/apache2/oidc/metadata
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/apache2/oidc/metadata
```

Set in your Apache configuration the `OIDCMetadataDir` pointing to that
directory

```ApacheConf
OIDCMetadataDir /var/lib/apache2/oidc/metadata
```

You may remove the `OIDCProviderMetadataURL`, `OIDCClientID` and
`OIDCClientSecret` options from the Apache configuration as these will be now
set in new files created in the metadata directory. For every provider you will
support, you need to create 3 files:

1. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.provider`
   with the OpenID Connect Discovery OP JSON metadata. The easiest way to create
   this file is getting its content from the OIDC server itself. For EGI
   Check-in:

   ```shell
   curl https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration > \
        /var/lib/apache2/oidc/metadata/aai-dev.egi.eu%2Foidc.provider
   ```

1. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.client`
   with the client credentials. For EGI Check-in (`aai-dev.egi.eu%2Foidc.client`):

   ```json
   {
     "client_id" : "<your client id>",
     "client_secret" : "<your secret id>"
   }
   ```

1. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.conf`
   with any extra configuration for the provider. This may not be needed if
   all your providers are similar. For example to specify the scopes to use for
   Check-in, use a `aai-dev.egi.eu%2Foidc.conf` as follows:

   ```json
   {
     "scope": "openid email profile eduperson_entitlement"
   }
   ```

Now add for the providers you support new configuration in Apache to facilitate
the use of the dashboard. This is for a configuration of an `egi.eu` identity
provider with `openid` as protocol:

```ApacheConf
<Location ~ "/identity/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/egi.eu/protocols/openid/websso">
        AuthType openid-connect
        # This is your Redirect URI with a new iss=<your idp iss> option added
        OIDCDiscoverURL https://openstack-test.test.fedcloud.eu/identity/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid/redirect?iss=https%3A%2F%2Faai-dev.egi.eu%2Foidc%2F
        # Ensure that the user is authenticated with the expected iss
        Require claim iss:https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/
        Require valid-user
</Location>
```

In your Horizon configuration, set the list of providers and their mappings:

```python
# this is the list that will show up in the dropdown menu
WEBSSO_CHOICES = (
    ("credentials", _("Keystone Credentials")),
    ("egi.eu", _("EGI Check-in")),
    ("other-idp", _("Other IdP")),
)

# this maps the options above to keystone's idps and protocols
WEBSSO_IDP_MAPPING = {
    "egi.eu": ("egi.eu", "openid"),
    "other-idp": ("other-idp.com", "openid")
}
```

##### ESACO configuration

ESACO will handle OAuth tokens when users hit your Keystone from API/CLI. It
needs to run as a daemon that listens (by default) on port 8156. We will use
docker for facilitating the deployment:

1. Create a yaml file with the configuration of the different providers
   (`application.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   oidc:
     clients:
     - issuer-url: https://aai-dev.egi.eu/oidc/
       client-id: "<your check-in client id>"
       client-secret: "<your check-in client secret>"
     - issuer-url: <another idp>
       client-id: "<your client id for second idp>"
       client-secret: "<your client secret for second idp>"
   ```

1. Create a environment file with the ESACO credentials you want to use
   (`esaco.env`):

   ```shell
   # User name credential requested from clients introspecting tokens
   ESACO_USER_NAME=<esaco user name>

   # Password  credential requested from clients introspecting tokens
   ESACO_USER_PASSWORD=<esaco password>
   ```

1. Run the ESACO server (adapt this as it better fits to run on your servers
   and make it run permanently):

   ```shell
   docker run -p 8156:8156 -d -env-file=esaco.env \
              -v application.yml:/esaco/config/application.yml:ro \
              indigoiam/esaco:latest
   ```

1. Configure Keystone's Apache to use ESACO as OAuth introspection endpoint:

   ```ApacheConf
   # point this to the host where ESACO is running
   OIDCOAuthIntrospectionEndpoint http://localhost:8156/introspect
   OIDCOAuthClientID              <esaco user name>
   OIDCOAuthClientSecret          <esaco password>
   OIDCIDTokenIatSlack            3600
   ```

1. Configure also the locations in Apache that should use OAuth:

   ```ApacheConf
   <Location ~ "/identity/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/egi.eu/protocols/openid/auth">
        Authtype oauth20
        Require valid-user
   </Location>

   <Location ~ "/identity/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/other_idp/protocols/openid/auth">
        Authtype oauth20
        Require valid-user
   </Location>
   ```

#### Moving to EGI Check-in production instance

Once tests in the development instance of Check-in are successful, you can move
to the production instance. You should open a [GGUS ticket](https://ggus.eu) for
the request. Besides you will need to update your configuration as follows:

- Update the `remote-id` of the identity provider:

  ```shell
  openstack identity provider set --remote-id https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/ egi.eu
  ```

- Update the `HTTP_OIDC_ISS` filter in your mappings, e.g.:

  ```shell
  sed -i 's/aai-dev.egi.eu/aai.egi.eu/' mapping.egi.json
  openstack mapping set --rules mapping.egi.json egi-mapping
  ```

- Update Apache configuration to use `aai.egi.eu` instead of
  `aai-dev.egi.eu`:

  ```ApacheConf
  OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
  OIDCOAuthIntrospectionEndpoint https://aai.egi.eu/oidc/introspect
  ```

{{% alert title="Changes in the production settings" color="info" %}} If you
want to make any changes to the client configuration of the production instance,
first make the changes in the Check-in development environment and then open a
[GGUS ticket](https://ggus.eu) to sync the changes to production. {{% /alert %}}

### VOMS Support

#### VOMS with FEDERATION-OS (Keystone API v3)

{{% alert title="Deprecated!" color="warning" %}} Configure VOMS with
FEDERATION-OS if your site needs to support a legacy VO relying on VOMS for
authorisation, check Keystone-VOMS below for older OpenStack versions.
{{% /alert %}}

VOMS authentication requires Keystone to be run as a WSGI application behind an
Apache server with [gridsite](https://github.com/CESNET/gridsite) and SSL
support. GridSite is a set of extensions to the Apache 2.x webserver, which
support Grid security based on X.509 certificates.

Packages for gridsite can be obtained from [CMD repository](https://repository.egi.eu/sw/production/cmd-os/1/).

First install the `gridsite`, `fetch-crl` and `ca-policy-egi-core` for your
distribution, ensuring that `gridsite` is at least version `2.3.2`. For Ubuntu
16.04:

```shell
apt-get install gridsite fetch-crl ca-policy-egi-core
```

Configure Apache to use gridsite module (this may differ in your distribution):

```shell
a2enmod zgridsite
```

Include these lines on your Apache config for the virtual host of your Keystone
service:

```ApacheConf
# Use the IGTF trust anchors for CAs and CRLs
SSLCACertificatePath /etc/grid-security/certificates/
SSLCARevocationPath /etc/grid-security/certificates/

# Verify clients if they send their certificate
SSLVerifyClient         optional
SSLVerifyDepth          10
SSLOptions              +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData

# Adapt this URL if needed for your deployment
<Location /v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/egi.eu/protocols/mapped/auth>
    # populate ENV variables
    GridSiteEnvs on
    # turn off directory listings
    GridSiteIndexes off
    # accept GSI proxies from clients
    GridSiteGSIProxyLimit 4
    # disable GridSite method extensions
    GridSiteMethods ""

    Require all granted
    Options -MultiViews
</Location>
```

Make sure that `mapped` authentication method exists in your `keystone.conf` in
the `[auth]` section:

```ini
[auth]

# This may change in your installation,
# add mapped to the list of the methods you support
methods = password, token, openid, mapped
```

Create an `egi.eu` identity provider and any needed groups as described in
[Keystone Federation Support](#keystone-federation-support) (do not forget to
add roles to the new group). Use those groups to create appropriate mappings to
the VOs you intend to support. You can use the `GRST_VOMS_FQANS` to match to the
VOMS FQAN that you want to create the mapping for. The following is an example
for the `fedcloud.egi.eu` VO:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ openstack group create fedcloud.egi.eu
+-------------+----------------------------------+

            {
                "type": "GRST_VOMS_FQANS",
                "any_one_of": [
                    "^/fedcloud.egi.eu/.*"
                ],
                "regex": true
            }
        ]

$ openstack mapping create --rules mapping.voms.json voms
+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| rules | [{u'remote': [{u'type': u'GRST_CONN_AURI_0'}, {u'regex': True, u'type': u'GRST_VOMS_FQANS', u'any_one_of': [u'^/fedcloud.egi.eu/.*']}], u'local': [{u'group': {u'id': u'7d9a21050cef48889f23eb9d5f7fef51'}, u'user': {u'type': u'ephemeral', u'name': u'{0}'}}]}] |
+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Finally add the `mapped` protocol to your `egi.eu` identity provider with the
mapping you have created:

```shell
$ openstack federation protocol create \
  --identity-provider egi.eu --mapping voms mapped
+-------------------+--------+
| Field             | Value  |
+-------------------+--------+
| id                | mapped |
| identity_provider | egi.eu |
| mapping           | voms   |
+-------------------+--------+
```

For every VO you support you should configure the corresponding `.lsc` files at
`/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/<vo name>/`. Those files depend on each VO, check
the [Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/) for details.
You can find below the `fedcloud.egi.eu` configuration:

```shell
$ cat /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/fedcloud.egi.eu/voms1.grid.cesnet.cz.lsc
/DC=cz/DC=cesnet-ca/O=CESNET/CN=voms1.grid.cesnet.cz
/DC=cz/DC=cesnet-ca/O=CESNET CA/CN=CESNET CA 3
$ cat /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/fedcloud.egi.eu/voms2.grid.cesnet.cz.lsc
/DC=cz/DC=cesnet-ca/O=CESNET/CN=voms2.grid.cesnet.cz
/DC=cz/DC=cesnet-ca/O=CESNET CA/CN=CESNET CA 3
```

You can test easily test the authentication is working using curl with your
proxy:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ curl -s --cert /tmp/x509up_u1000 \
  https://<your keystone host>/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/egi.eu/protocols/mapped/auth | \
  python -mjson.tool

#### Keystone-VOMS (Keystone API v2)

{{% alert title="Deprecated!" color="warning" %}} **VOMS Support using
Keystone-VOMS is no longer supported from OpenStack Queens onwards**. You should
use
[VOMS with FEDERATION-OS (Keystone API v3)](#voms-with-federation-os-keystone-api-v3)
or [OpenID Connect Support](#openid-connect-support) instead. {{% /alert %}}

Support for authenticating users with X.509 certificates with VOMS extensions is
achieved with Keystone-VOMS extension. Documentation is available at
<https://keystone-voms.readthedocs.io/>

Notes:

- **You need a host certificate from a recognised CA for your keystone server**.
- Take into account that using keystone-voms plugin will **enforce the use of
  https for your Keystone service**, you will need to update your URLs in the
  configuration of your services if your current installation is not using
  https:

  - you will probably need to include your CA to your system\'s CA bundle to
    avoid certificate validation issues: Check the
    [Federated Cloud OpenStack Client guide](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Federated_Cloud_APIs_and_SDKs#CA_CertificatesCheck)
    on how to do it.
  - replace http with https in `auth_[protocol|uri|url]` and
    `auth_[host|uri|url]` in the nova, cinder, glance and neutron config files
    (`/etc/nova/nova.conf`, `/etc/nova/api-paste.ini`,
    `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`, `/etc/neutron/api-paste.ini`,
    `/etc/neutron/metadata_agent.ini`, `/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`,
    `/etc/cinder/api-paste.ini`, `/etc/glance/glance-api.conf`,
    `/etc/glance/glance-registry.conf`, `/etc/glance/glance-cache.conf`) and any
    other service that needs to check keystone tokens.
  - Update the URLs of the services directly in the database:

  <!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
  ```mysql
  mysql> use keystone;
  mysql> update endpoint set url="https://<keystone-host>:5000/v2.0" where url="http://<keystone-host>:5000/v2.0";
  mysql> update endpoint set url="https://<keystone-host>:35357/v2.0" where url="http://<keystone-host>:35357/v2.0";
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

- Most sites should enable the `autocreate_users` option in the `[voms]` section
  of
  [Keystone-VOMS configuration](https://keystone-voms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html).
  This will enable new users to be automatically created in your local keystone
  the first time they login into your site.
- if (and only if) you need to configure the Per-User Subproxy (PUSP) feature,
  please follow the
  [specific guide](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Long-tail_of_science_-_information_for_providers#Instructions_for_OpenStack_providers).

## EGI Accounting

There are two different processes handling the accounting integration:

- cASO, which connects to the OpenStack deployment to get the usage information,
  and,
- ssmsend, which sends that usage information to the central EGI accounting
  repository.

They should be run by cron periodically, settings below run cASO every hour and
ssmsend every six hours.

### Using the VM Appliance

[cASO configuration](http://caso.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html)
is stored at `/etc/caso/caso.conf`. Most default values should be ok, but you
must set:

- `site_name` (line 12), with the name of your site as defined in GOCDB.

- `projects` (line 20), with the list of projects you want to extract accounting
  from.

- credentials to access the accounting data (lines 28-47, more options also
  available). Check the
  [cASO documentation](http://caso.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html#openstack-configuration)
  for the expected permissions of the user configured here.

- The mapping from EGI VOs to your local projects `/etc/caso/voms.json`,
  following this format: :

  ```json
  {
    "vo name": {
      "projects": [
        "project A that accounts for the vo",
        "project B that accounts for the VO"
      ]
    },
    "another vo": {
      "projects": ["project C that accounts for the VO"]
    }
  }
  ```

cASO will write records to `/var/spool/apel` from where ssmsend will take them.

SSM configuration is available at `/etc/apel`. Defaults should be ok for most
cases. The cron file uses `/etc/grid-security` for the CAs and the host
certificate and private keys (`/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem` and
`/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem`).

#### Running the services

Both caso and ssmsend are run via the root user crontab. For convenience there
are two scripts `/usr/local/bin/caso-extract.sh` and
`/usr/local/bin/ssm-send.sh` that run the docker container with the proper
volumes.

## EGI Information System

Information discovery provides a real-time view about the actual images and
flavors available at the OpenStack for the federation users. It runs as a
single python application
[cloud-info-provider](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/cloud-info-provider)
that pushes information through the [Argo Messaging Service
(AMS)](https://argoeu.github.io/guides/messaging/)

{{% alert title="BDII is deprecated" color="info" %}}
Cloud providers no longer need to provide BDII as the Argo Messaging Service
is used instead for transferring information
{{% /alert %}}

You can either run the service by yourself or rely on central operations of the
cloud-info-provider. In both cases you must register your host DN in the GOCDB
entry for the `org.openstack.nova`.

### Catch-all operations

EGI can manage the operation of the `cloud-info-provider` for the site so you
don't need to do it. In order for your site to be included in the centrally
operated `cloud-info-provider`, you need to create a Pull Request at the
[EGI-Federation/fedcloud-catchall-operations
repository](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/fedcloud-catchall-operations/)
adding your site configuration in the `sites` directory with a file like this:

```yaml
endpoint: <your endpoint as declared in GOCDB>
gocdb: <your site name as declared in GOCDB>
vos:
# a list of VOs you support in your deployment as follows
- auth:
    project_id: <local OpenStack project identifier>
  name: <name of the vo>
- auth:
    project_id: <local OpenStack project identifier for second VO>
  name: <name of another vo>
```

Once PR is merged, the service will be reconfigured and your site should start

## Local operations

You can operate by yourself the `cloud-info-provider`. The software can be
obtained as RPMs, debs and python packages from the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/cloud-info-provider/releases).

The `cloud-info-provider` needs a configuration file where your site is
described, see the [sample OpenStack
configuration](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/cloud-info-provider/blob/master/etc/sample.openstack.yaml)
for the required information. The authentication parameters for your local
OpenStack and the AMS are passed as command line options:

```shell
cloud-info-provider-service --yaml-file <your site description.yaml> \
                            --middleware openstack \
                            --os-auth-url <your keystone URL> \
                            [ any other options for authentication ]
                            --format glue21 \
                            --publisher ams \
                            --ams-cert <your host certificate> \
                            --ams-key <your host secret key> \
                            --ams-topic <your endpoint topic>
```

For authentication, you should be able to use any authentication method
supported by [keystoneauth](https://opendev.org/openstack/keystoneauth), for
user name and password use: `--os-password` and `--os-username`. Check the
complete list of options with `cloud-info-provider-service  --help`.

The AMS topic has the format: `SITE_<SITE_NAME>_ENDPOINT_<GOCDB_ID>`, where
`<SITE_NAME>` is the name of the site as declared in GOCDB and `<GOCDB_ID>` is
the id of the endpoint in GOCDB. For example, [this
endpoint](https://goc.egi.eu/portal/index.php?Page_Type=Service&id=7513) would
have a topic like: `SITE_IFCA-LCG2_ENDPOINT_7513G0`.

You should periodically run the cloud-info-provider (e.g. with a cron
every 5 minutes) to push the information for consumption by clients.

### Using the EGI FedCloud Appliance

The appliance provides a ready-to-use cloud-info-provider configuration
if you want to operate it by yourself. Once you have downloaded the appliance
check the following files:

- `/etc/cloud-info-provider/openstack.rc`: the configuration of the
  account used to log into your OpenStack and the location of the host
  certificate that will be used to authenticate to the AMS.

- `/etc/cloud-info-provider/openstack.yaml`: the cloud-info-provider
  configuration. You need to enter the details about the VOs/projects that
  the site is supporting.

The appliance has a cron job that will connect to the configured OpenStack API
and send messages every 5 minutes.

## EGI VM Image Management

VM Images are replicated using `cloudkeeper`, which has two
components:

- fronted (cloudkeeper-core) dealing the with image lists and downloading the
  needed images, run periodically with cron
- backend (cloudkeeper-os) dealing with your glance catalogue, running
  permanently.

### Using the VM Appliance

Every 4 hours, the appliance will perform the following actions:

- download the configured lists in `/etc/cloudkeeper/image-lists.conf` and
  verify its signature
- check any changes in the lists and download new images
- synchronise this information to the configured glance endpoint

First you need to configure and start the backend. Edit
`/etc/cloudkeeper-os/cloudkeeper-os.conf` and add the authentication parameters
from line 117 to 136.

Then add as many image lists (one per line) as you would like to subscribe to
`/etc/cloudkeeper/image-lists.conf`. Use URLs with your AppDB token for
authentication, check the following guides for getting such token and URLs:

- [how to access to VO-wide image lists](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_get_access_to_vo-wide_image_lists),
  and
- [how to subscribe to a private image list](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_subscribe_to_a_private_image_list_using_the_vmcatcher).

#### Running the services

cloudkeeper-os should run permanently, there is a `cloudkeeper-os.service` for
systemd in the appliance. Manage as usual:

```shell
systemctl <start|stop|status> cloudkeeper-os
```

cloudkeeper core is run every 4 hours with a cron script.

## Upgrading the OpenStack Appliance

## From 2018.05.07 or newer to 2021.03.12

Configuration changes:

- Removes BDII, service is no longer in use
- A cloud-info-provider cron is added
- Uses AMS for pushing accounting records. New configuration
  file for ssmsend is available

### From 2017.08.09 to 2018.05.07

Configuration changes:

- This upgrade moves the `voms.json` file to the respective `caso` and
  `cloudkeeper-os` directories under `/etc/`
- No other changes in configuration are needed

### From 20160403 to 2017.08.09

There are several major changes between these versions, namely:

- atrope has been deprecated and cloudkeeper is used instead. The configuration
  cannot be reused directly and the new services need to be configured as
  described above
- caso is upgraded to version 1.1.1, the configuration file has some
  incompatible changes.
- A new bdii.service is available for managing the process is available.
