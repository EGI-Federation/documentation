In this section you can find the common operational activities related to keep
the service available to our users.

## Initial set-up

### Notebooks VO

The resources used for the Notebooks deployments are managed with the
`vo.notebooks.egi.eu` VO. Operators of the service should join the VO, check the
entry at the
[operations portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vo/view/voname/vo.notebooks.egi.eu)
and at [AppDB](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vo/vo.notebooks.egi.eu).

### Clients installation

In order to manage the resources you will need these tools installed on your
client machine:

- `egicli` for discovering sites and managing tokens,
- `terraform` to create the VMs at the providers,
- `ansible` to configure the VMs and install kubernetes at the providers,
- `terraform-inventory` to get the list of hosts to use from terraform.

### Get the configuration repo

All the configuration of the notebooks is stored at a git repo available in
keybase. You\'ll need to be part of the `opslife` team in keybase to access.
Start by cloning the repo:

```shell
git clone keybase://team/opslife/egi-notebooks
```

## Kubernetes

We use `terraform` and `ansible` to build the cluster at one of the EGI Cloud
providers. If you are building the cluster for the first time, create a new
directory on your local git repository from the template, add it to the repo,
and get `terraform` ready:

```shell
cp -a template <new provider>
git add <new provider>
cd <new provider>/terraform
terraform init
```

Using the `egicli` you can get the list of projects and their ids for a given
site:

```shell
$ egicli endpoint projects --site CESGA
id                                Name                 enabled    site
--------------------------------  -------------------  ---------  ------
3a8e9d966e644405bf19b536adf7743d  vo.access.egi.eu     True       CESGA
916506ac136741c28e4326975eef0bff  vo.emso-eric.eu      True       CESGA
b1d2ef2cc2284c57bcde21cf4ab141e3  vo.nextgeoss.eu      True       CESGA
eb7ff20e603d471cb731bdb83a95a2b5  fedcloud.egi.eu      True       CESGA
fcaf23d103c1485694e7494a59ee5f09  vo.notebooks.egi.eu  True       CESGA
```

And with the project ID, you can obtain all the environment variables needed to
interact with the OpenStack APIs of the site:

```shell
eval "$(egicli endpoint env --site CESGA --project-id fcaf23d103c1485694e7494a59ee5f09)"
```

Now you are ready to use the openstack or terraform at the site. The token
obtained is valid for 1 hour, you can refresh it at any time with:

```shell
eval "$(egicli endpoint token --site CESGA --project-id fcaf23d103c1485694e7494a59ee5f09)"
```

First get the network IDs and pool to use for the site:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ openstack network list
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name                    | Subnets                              |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 1aaf20b6-47a1-47ef-972e-7b36872f678f | net-vo.notebooks.egi.eu | 6465a327-c261-4391-a0f5-d503cc2d43d3 |
| 6174db12-932f-4ee3-bb3e-7a0ca070d8f2 | public00                | 6af8c4f3-8e2e-405d-adea-c0b374c5bd99 |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

In this case we will use `public00` as the pool for public IPs and
`1aaf20b6-47a1-47ef-972e-7b36872f678f` as the network ID. Check with the
provider which is the right network to use. Use these values in the
`terraform.tfvars` file:

```terraform
ip_pool = "public00"
net_id  = "1aaf20b6-47a1-47ef-972e-7b36872f678f"
```

You may want to check the right flavors for your VMs and adapt other variables
in `terraform.tfvars`. To get a list of flavors you can use:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ openstack flavor list
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| ID                                   | Name           |   RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| 26d14547-96f2-4751-a686-f89a9f7cd9cc | cor4mem8hd40   |  8192 |   40 |         0 |     4 | True      |
| 42eb9c81-e556-4b63-bc19-4c9fb735e344 | cor2mem2hd20   |  2048 |   20 |         0 |     2 | True      |
| 4787d9fc-3923-4fc9-b770-30966fc3baee | cor4mem4hd40   |  4096 |   40 |         0 |     4 | True      |
| 58586b06-7b9d-47af-b9d0-e16d49497d09 | cor24mem62hd60 | 63488 |   60 |         0 |    24 | True      |
| 635c739a-692f-4890-b8fd-d50963bff00e | cor1mem1hd10   |  1024 |   10 |         0 |     1 | True      |
| 6ba0080d-d71c-4aff-b6f9-b5a9484097f8 | small          |   512 |    2 |         0 |     1 | True      |
| 6e514065-9013-4ce1-908a-0dcc173125e4 | cor2mem4hd20   |  4096 |   20 |         0 |     2 | True      |

| c4aa496b-4684-4a86-bd7f-3a67c04b1fa6 | cor24mem50hd50 | 51200 |   50 |         0 |    24 | True      |
| edac68c3-50ea-42c2-ae1d-76b8beb306b5 | test-bigHD     |  4096 |  237 |         0 |     2 | True      |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Finally ensure your public ssh key is also listed in the `cloud-init.yaml` file
and then you are ready to deploy the cluster with:

```shell
terraform apply
```

Your VMs are up and running, it\'s time to get kubernetes configured and running
with ansible.

The following ansible role needs to be installed first:

```shell
ansible-galaxy install grycap.kubernetes
```

and then:

```shell
cd ..   # you should be now in <new provider>
ANSIBLE_TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS=silently TF_STATE=./terraform \
  ansible-playbook --inventory-file=$(which terraform-inventory) \
  playbooks/k8s.yaml
```

### Interacting with the cluster

As the master will be on a private IP, you won\'t be able to directly interact
with it, but you can still ssh into the VM using the ingress node as a gateway
host (you can get the different hosts with
`TF_STATE=./terraform terraform-inventory --inventory`)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -W %h:%p -q egi@<ingress ip>" \
      -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null egi@<master ip>
egi@k8s-master:~$ kubectl get nodes

certs-man        2           Wed Jan  8 15:56:58 2020    DEPLOYED    cert-manager-v0.11.0            v0.11.0     cert-manager
cluster-ingress  3           Wed Jan  8 15:56:53 2020    DEPLOYED    nginx-ingress-1.7.0             0.24.1      kube-system

```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

### Modifying/Destroying the cluster

You should be able to change the number of workers in the cluster and re-apply
terraform to start them and then execute the playbook to get them added to the
cluster.

Any changes in the master, NFS or ingress VMs should be done carfully as those
will probably break the configuration of the kubernetes cluster and of any
application running on top.

Destroying the cluster can be done with a single command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Notebooks deployments

Once the k8s cluster is up and running, you can deploy a notebooks instance. For
each deployment you should create a file in the `deployments` directory
following the template provided:

```shell
cp deployments/hub.yaml.template deployments/hub.yaml
```

Each deployment will need a domain name pointing to your ingress host, you can
create one at the [FedCloud dynamic DNS service](https://nsupdate.fedcloud.eu/).

Then you will need to create an OpenID Connect client for EGI Check-in to
authorise users into the new deployment. You can create a client by going to the
[Check-in demo OIDC clients management](https://aai-demo.egi.eu/oidc/manage/admin/clients).
Use the following as redirect URL:
`https://<your host domain name>/hub/oauth_callback`.

In the _Access_ tab, add `offline_access` to the list of scopes. Save the client
and take note of the client ID and client secret for later.

Finally you will also need 3 different random strings generated with
`openssl rand -hex 32` that will be used as secrets in the file describing the
deployment.

Go and edit the deployment description file to add this information (search for
`# FIXME NEEDS INPUT` in the file to quickly get there)

For deploying the notebooks instance we will also use `ansible`:

```shell
ANSIBLE_TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS=silently \
     TF_STATE=./terraform ansible-playbook \
     --inventory-file=$(which terraform-inventory) playbooks/notebooks.yaml
```

The first deployment trial may fail due to a timeout caused by the downloading
of the container images needed. You can retry after a while to re-deploy.

In the master you can check the status of your deployment (the name of the
deployment will be the same as the name of your local deployment file):

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```shell

NOTES:
Thank you for installing JupyterHub!

Your release is named hub and installed into the namespace hub.

You can find if the hub and proxy is ready by doing:

kubectl --namespace=hub get pod

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Running'.

You can find the public IP of the JupyterHub by doing:

kubectl --namespace=hub get svc proxy-public

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!

Note that this is still an alpha release! If you have questions, feel free to
1. Read the guide at https://z2jh.jupyter.org
2. Chat with us at https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub
3. File issues at https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues
```

### Updating a deployment

Just edit the deployment description file and run ansible again. The helm will
be upgraded at the cluster.
