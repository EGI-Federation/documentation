  Access new services from the Notebooks

Notebooks running on EGI can access other existing computing and storage
services. The centrally operated EGI Notebooks instance is using
resources from the access.egi.eu Virtual Organisation. We are open to
suggestions on which services you would like to access to create
guidelines and extend the service with tools to ease these tasks.

## AGINFRA+/D4Science

An instance of the EGI notebooks is deployed for the
[AGINFRA+](http://plus.aginfra.eu/) project and made available via
selected [D4Science VREs](https://www.d4science.org/). Besides the
features available in the catch-all instance of Notebooks, this
instance has been further customised to support:

-   Embedding the EGI notebooks interface into the community we portal,
    no separate web browser windows or tab to access the notebooks
    functionality.
-   Integration of AAI between Notebooks and the community portal for
    single-sign on. Enabled users are automatically recognised by the
    notebooks.
-   Access to other VRE services from the notebooks using their personal
    token easily available in the notebooks environment.
-   File sharing between notebooks and the community web portal file
    space.
