Grid Configuration Database (GOCDB) contains general information about the
sites participating to the production infrastructure. Accessed by all the project actors
(end-users, site managers, NGI mangers, support teams, VO managers), by other
tools and by third party middleware in order to get the infrastructure topology. The portal
has a single central installation but interested NGIs can download and install
their own instance.
