The Grid Configuration Database (GOCDB) contains general information about the
sites participating to the production infrastructure.
It's used by all the actors (end-users, site managers, NGI mangers, support
teams, VO managers), by other tools and by third party middleware to discover
information about the infrastructure topology.
The portal has a single central installation but interested NGIs can download
and install their own instance.
