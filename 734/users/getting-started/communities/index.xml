&lt;p>EGI and the Pangeo community in Europe have forged
&lt;a href="https://www.egi.eu/case-study/pangeo/">a collaboration&lt;/a>
to provide deployments of the Pangeo ecosystem using the computing
resources offered by the European Open Science Cloud
(&lt;a href="https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/">EOSC&lt;/a>). Read on to learn more about
how to get involved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many scientific domains have been transformed into data-driven disciplines.
Research projects increasingly and crucially depend on the exchange and
processing of data and have developed platforms tailored to their needs.
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/">Pangeo&lt;/a>, a world-wide community driven platform initially
developed for Geoscience, has a huge potential to become a common gateway able
to leverage a wide variety of infrastructures and data providers for various
science fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Public pangeo deployments that are providing fast access to large amounts of
data and compute resources are all USA-based and members from the Pangeo
community in Europe do not have a shared platform where scientists or
technologists can exchange know-how. The main objective of this collaboration
with EGI is to demonstrate how to deploy and use Pangeo on EOSC and underlined
the benefits for the European community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>EGI and the Pangeo community in Europe are interacting openly via a GitHub
repository: &lt;a href="https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-eosc/">pangeo-eosc&lt;/a>. Visit
