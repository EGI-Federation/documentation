&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Resource Centre (RC) is the smallest resource administration domain in the EGI
Federation. It can be either localised or geographically distributed and
provides a minimum set of local or remote IT Services compliant with
well-defined IT Capabilities (HTC, Cloud, Storage, etc.) necessary to make
resources accessible to Users. EGI is a Resource Infrastructure federating RCs
to constitute a homogeneous operational domain.&lt;/p>

Related procedure:
&lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/x/FSAmBg">PROC09 Resource Centre Registration and Certification&lt;/a>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable no-inline-html -->
&lt;p>In order to join the EOSC Compute platform, a RC needs to present the request to
the Research Infrastructure Provider (RP) existing in its country. A RP is a
legal organisation, part of large Resource Infrastructures like EGI, responsible
for managing and operating a number of operational services at national level
supporting RCs and user communities that contribute to such RIs. Please have a
look at the &lt;a href="../../operations_start_guide">Operations Start Guide&lt;/a> to get
familiar with the terms mentioned above and to have a complete picture of the
several actors participating in our landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RP operators are going to guide and support the RC during the registration
and certification procedures. First, the RC will be asked to read, understand,
and accept:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the &lt;a href="https://documents.egi.eu/document/31">“RCs Operational Level Agreement”&lt;/a>,
an agreement made between the RC and its RP that defines the minimum set of
operational services and the respective quality parameters that a Resource
Centre is required to provide in EGI;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the &lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/x/9wbSB">Security Policies&lt;/a> defined in EGI to
guarantee that all the security aspects with the service delivery are
fulfilled and enforced.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The next step is registering the RC in the EGI
&lt;a href="https://goc.egi.eu/">Configuration Database&lt;/a>: the provided information, from
the generic contacts and roles of people to the service endpoints details will
be needed to trigger the daily operations of other services and activities
provided by the EGI Infrastructure such as the Monitoring of the resources, the
Accounting, the Support, and the security activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="SiteStatusFlow.png" alt="Diagram of the RCs status flow">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the entry in the Configuration Database is complete, the RP changes the RC
status from “Candidate” to “Uncertified”, and the certification procedure can
start: it comprises a series of technical controls to verify that the provided
services work according to the expectations in the RC OLA. Any identified issue
is notified by the RP operators to the RC and investigated until its solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When all the certification controls are successfully passed, the RC status is
changed to “Certified” meaning that the RC is included in the production
infrastructure and its resources can be consumed by the users of the
infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-agreements-with-customers">Setting up agreements with customers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once moved to the production infrastructure, a RC is ready to deliver its
resources to any of the users’ communities consuming the infrastructure. Here
the Service Level Management (SLM) process intervenes as a matchmaker between
service expectations and needs of the
&lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/x/yIIkBQ">Virtual Organisations (VOs)&lt;/a> and the
capabilities of the RCs. During the selection of the providers for service
provisioning, technical requirements collected from the customer are used by EGI
to launch a call open to all of the providers. The Expression of Interests
(EoIs) collected during the negotiation phase will be used to identify the
provider(s) that best match the customer&amp;rsquo;s requirements and expectations. From a
technical perspective, several aspects will be considered during the negotiation
phase including the geographical location of the customer, national roadmap and
priority of the providers, and costs of the service provisioning in case of a
pay-for-use model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case the negotiation phase ends positively, the selected provider(s) will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define a VO Operational Level Agreement(s) (OLA) with EGI Foundation for
providing the services through the EGI Portfolio to support the user
community. EGI Foundation will share with the RCs a draft of the document(s)
based on a predefined template and customised with the details of the specific
Agreement(s), such as:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the main contacts to be used for communications related to the service(s);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the duration of the Agreement;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conditions for operating the service (service hours and exceptions);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Service Level Targets;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if the resources are exclusively allocated or are subject to local
availability;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the payment mode;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>responsibility in case of violations and complaints;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>any limitations and constraints (if any);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the frequency of service performance reports.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure the service(s) in the scope of the Agreement(s) enabling the support
of the Customer&amp;rsquo;s VO and activating the monitoring of the services/resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At the same time, EGI Foundation sets up a VO Service Level Agreement (SLA) with
the given user community for the provisioning of the requested service. The EGI
VO SLA is secured with related EGI VO OLAs and is agreed on a case-by-case basis
(Fig.3).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="SLAs-Picture.png" alt="Relationship between SLA and OLA">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once approved, the Agreement is automatically renewed, as long as the
provider(s) does (do) not express a decision to terminate the Agreement at least
a month before the expiration date. In case of termination of the Agreement, the
provider must remove the support of the customer. The Agreement can also be
terminated by the customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managing-service-orders">Managing service orders&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Customers can request access to the services of the EOSC Compute Platform
through the EOSC Portal Marketplace. Access to the services is either fully
open, or behind service-specific authentication and authorisation steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the nature of the service ordered, different levels of technical
support are requested to the service providers including the activation of a new
Virtual Organisation (VO), or the customization of the service with dedicated
set-up to meet the customer&amp;rsquo;s expectations. Service providers receive
notifications about services orders via
&lt;a href="https://opsportal.eosc-portal.eu/login/">SOMBO&lt;/a> and with the support and
oversight of the EGI Foundation they deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="incidents-and-service-requests">Incidents and service requests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Providing support is a fundamental part of the daily activity of a provider
participating in a large research infrastructure like EGI. The support is meant
not only towards the users accessing the resources but also towards those who
are involved in the management and oversight of the infrastructure. As defined
in the RC OLA, the RC will handle
&lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Incident">incidents&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Service+request">service requests&lt;/a>
registered as tickets in the EGI Helpdesk service, with the expectation to
acknowledge and process any notified issue within the agreed response time
associated with the priority of the ticket. The response time is defined by the
Quality of &lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/x/ygCrB">Support levels&lt;/a>, and for the RCs
the level will be Medium, meaning that there will 4 priorities for the incidents
(requiring for example up to 5 working days for the “less urgent” tickets and up
to 1 working day for the “top priority” ones), while any service request will be
processed as “less urgent” ticket.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="performance-reports-enforcing-olas">Performance reports: enforcing OLAs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As defined in the RCs OLA, the performance of the delivered services should meet
the Service Level Targets: the monthly performance of the RCs is monitored, and
when the targets are not achieved for three consecutive months, the affected RCs
are notified through a ticket about the OLA violation and requested to provide
within 10 working days an explanation for the low performance and a plan for
improvement. The RCs not providing a satisfactory explanation or not replying at
all are eligible for suspension. In order to re-join the EGI Infrastructure, any
suspended RC should undergo a new certification procedure. The “Suspended”
status cannot last for more than 4 months, after which a RCs is either in
production again or definitely closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the Targets defined in the RCs OLA which are enforced to guarantee the
permanence of the RC in the infrastructure, also the targets promised to the
users in the VO SLAs should be met on a monthly basis: also in this case, when a
violation occurs, the RC is requested to provide a justification and a plan for
improving the quality of the provided services. If repeated violations occur,
the SLA can be renegotiated with the customer, either by changing the Service
Level Targets, or by choosing a different RCs as a provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dealing-with-security-incidents-and-vulnerabilities">Dealing with security incidents and vulnerabilities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The security posture of the infrastructure is framed by the set of policies
constituting the &lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/security-policies">Security Policies&lt;/a>. Those
policies cover different complementary activities including the operation of
services, the processing of personal data and the management of security
incidents and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-security-incidents">Dealing with security incidents&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/security-incident-response-policy">Security Incident Response Policy&lt;/a>
aims at ensuring that all incidents are investigated as fully as possible, and
that Resource Centres promptly report intrusions. In particular, security
incidents are to be treated as serious matters and their investigation must be
resourced appropriately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case of the suspected security incidents, Resources Centres report it to
their Operations Centre Security Officer and to EGI Computer Security Incident
Response Team (CSIRT) within 4 hours of discovery. This initial step will start
the coordination of the incident response as documented in the procedure
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/sec01">SEC01 EGI CSIRT Security Incident Handling Procedure&lt;/a>.
This procedure has been implemented according to the Security Incident Response
Policy, to minimise the impact of security incidents affecting the Resource
Centres part of the infrastructure. This procedure covers guidance on how the
incident response should be coordinated, describing the responsibilities of the
various parties, and encourages post-mortem analysis and promotes cooperation
between Resource Centres.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="handling-of-vulnerabilities">Handling of vulnerabilities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The handling of vulnerabilities is a very formal process involving many
different entities, as presented below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone can report a software vulnerability via a
&lt;a href="https://csirt.egi.eu/report-vulnerability/">form&lt;/a> or by email contacting the
Software Vulnerability Group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report will trigger an assessment, following the
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/sec02">SEC02 Software Vulnerability Issue Handling&lt;/a>
procedure, by the Software Vulnerability Group (SVG), of the risk level
associated with this vulnerability in the context of the activities of the EGI
Infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once a vulnerability has been identified as presenting a risk to the
infrastructure, it will be decided if an advisory should be prepared and
circulated to the security contacts of the sites. After an agreed period of time
and depending on their confidentiality, advisories are made public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vulnerabilities identified as critical are handled according to the procedure
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/sec03">SEC03 EGI-CSIRT Critical Vulnerability Handling&lt;/a>. When
applicable, this usually involves developing a custom
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ARGOeu/secmon-probes/">security monitoring probe&lt;/a> created to
identify on High Throughput Compute RCs if their resources are vulnerable to the
vulnerability. The status is closely monitored by the security team and
accessible to the affected RCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using this information correlated with the one from
&lt;a href="https://pakiti.egi.eu/">Pakiti&lt;/a> (the patch management service collecting
information about the patches deployed at the various High Throughput Compute
RCs), the Incident Response Task Force (IRTF) on duty security officer will open
tickets against the impacted sites according to the
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/wi07">WI07 Security Vulnerability Handling&lt;/a> procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EGI Service Delivery and Information Security (SDIS) team of the EGI
Foundation will follow up with the resource provider to work on resolving the
ticket. The first duty of the resource provider is to acknowledge the
vulnerability and then work on a prompt resolution as suggested in the ticket.
In case a satisfactory resolution is not reached in due time, or a sign of
active progress on addressing the vulnerability is not visible, the specific
resource centre may be suspended.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providers: Joining as a new provider of existing services</title><link>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/new-provider/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/new-provider/</guid><description>
&lt;p>To become a provider of one of these services you first have to become provider
of an EGI Foundation service within the ‘federated resources’ block. Once such
a foundational role is fulfilled you can configure/deploy the additional service
within your resource centre. This pre-requirement typically requires you to
become an EGI Cloud service provider, i.e. deploy OpenStack and federate it into
the EGI Cloud Compute service.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providers: Joining as a provider of a Core Service</title><link>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/core-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/core-services/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the term “central” or “core service” we refer to a category of services in
the EOSC Compute Platform (like the service management tools) providing
capabilities that support the other services of the infrastructure and the
related activities. They are delivered through a single instance (with the
failover and high-availability mechanisms deemed necessary), and differently
from services with a distributed nature such as HTC, Cloud, and Storage, they
cannot be ordered through the Marketplace, but they become available as soon as
a user joins the infrastructure (e.g., the access to the EGI Helpdesk service).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="selection-of-the-providers-and-registration">Selection of the providers and registration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When a service is co-funded by EGI Foundation, which usually covers part of the
funding associated to a given international project, the providers are selected
through a bidding process: a call of expression of interest is announced and
advertised to the &lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/EGI+Council">EGI Council&lt;/a>
containing the technical details of the services that should be delivered and
then any provider who is an
&lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/EGI+Participant">EGI Participant&lt;/a> can apply to
the bid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the selected providers, EGI Foundation negotiate and sign an OLA defining
terms and conditions for the delivery of the services, starting the process
within Service Portfolio Management (SPM) to add them to the
&lt;a href="https://www.egi.eu/services/">EGI Service portfolio&lt;/a> if not already included.
At this point, similar steps to the ones for resource and technology providers
follow in order to guarantee the regular day-to-day operation of the service,
such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>registration in the Configuration Database and certification;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>definition of the Support Unit in the Helpdesk system to handle incidents and
service requests;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enabling of the monitoring;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>periodic performance reports as defined in the given OLA to verify that the
Service Level Targets are achieved.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to this, the providers are also requested to create a capacity plan,
an availability and continuity plan, and to interact with Change Management
(CHM) and Release and Deployment Management (RDM) processes for managing changes
and new releases of their services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="capacity-plan">Capacity plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The capacity plan is important to assess if the capacity of the service is
sufficient to respond to the current and to the future demand of the service.
Any capacity aspect of the service delivery is analysed (human, technical, and
financial) with the definition of quantitative parameters to measure the usage
and the load of the service. The approach to adjust the capacity of the service
in relation to a change in the demand is defined and recommendations on capacity
requirements for the next reporting period are provided as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EGI Foundation defined a template for the Capacity plans and will contact and
support the service providers either for the creation of a new Capacity plan or
for the review of an existing one (the reviews are usually performed at least
twice per year).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="availability-and-continuity-plan">Availability and continuity plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the Availability and Continuity plan a number of risks affecting the
availability and continuity of the service is identified and assessed: each risk
is rated in terms of likelihood and impact with the definition of
countermeasures to implement that should avoid the occurrence of the given risk.
Any remaining vulnerability is identified as well, and in case the rating of a
risk is considered to be too high in relation to the risk acceptance criteria, a
plan either to improve the existing countermeasures or to implement new ones is
created, with the aim either to reduce the likelihood of a risk or to mitigate
the impact in case a risk occurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plan is completed by a continuity and recovery test, where the continuity of
the service and its recovery capacity are tested against a simulated disruption
scenario: the performance of this test is useful to spot any issue in the
recovery procedures of the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also in this case, the discussion of the Availability and Continuity plan is
started and overseen by EGI Foundation who shares with the providers a template
that will be filled in with the details of the given service. Availability and
Continuity plans are reviewed on a yearly basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managing-changes-and-new-releases">Managing changes and new releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All changes to the services should be managed by the EGI Change Management (CHM)
process according to the
&lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIPP/Change+management+policy">Change Policy&lt;/a>
in order to evaluate the potential impact that a change can have on the service
itself and on the infrastructure as a whole. When registering a Request for
Change, besides a general description of the change, the providers are expected
to provide: the risk level as a result of assessing the impact and the
likelihood of things going wrong, the type of change, the eventual list of other
services potentially affected by the change, if it is possible to revert the
change, the proposed date for the implementation of the change, and if it is
needed to schedule a downtime of the service. Requests for Changes are assessed
by the Change Advisory Board (CAB), and then decided whether the Change is going
to be approved or rejected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the recurrent changes with a relatively low risk level, the providers can
request to classify them as Standard Changes, so that invoking the CAB won’t be
necessary and they can undergo the release process after the release plan is
agreed with CHM staff. The Emergency Changes are created when there is an urgent
need to fix either a newly discovered security vulnerability or a critical
issue: also in this case the formal approval of the CAB is not required but it
is enough that the release plan is accepted by CHM staff. In all of the other
situations the changes are classified as Normal and depending on their risk
level they might need to be assessed by the CAB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the release in the production environment, the providers invite the users
to test the new changes on a pre-production instance in order to gather feedback
and to find out possible issues that might be overlooked during the preparation
of the new release. If no problems are found, the release can go live, and a
Post-Implementation Review is conducted after a few days to close the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="security-aspects">Security aspects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The providers of central services are subject to the same policies, procedures
and requirements applied to the federated service providers, as documented in
their page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, they are also subject to the following requirement that is
documented in the service Operational Level Agreement (OLA) that is being agreed
with them:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They should immediately report suspected security incidents to the EGI
Foundation. This is not exempting them to follow the
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/sec01">SEC01 EGI CSIRT Security Incident Handling Procedure&lt;/a>
and inform EGI CSIRT within 4 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also important to understand that when processing of personal data is
taking place, EGI Foundation holds the role of Data Controller and the provider
is a Data Processor, as defined in the
&lt;a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/">Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a>.
Data Processing Agreements, regulating the conditions and constraints of the
data processing activities conducted by the Data Processor on behalf of the Data
controller, will be put in place on the initiative of the EGI Foundation staff.
EGI Foundation will also prepare, together with the central service provider,
adequate Privacy and Acceptable Use policies that have to be presented and made
available to the users of the service. EGI Foundation is also complying with all
the principles set out by the GÉANT Data Protection Code of Conduct in its more
recent version, implying that the central service provider should also comply
with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The central service provider should also follow requirements relating to the
software and covering the usage of a proper licence, the access to and
management of the source code, implementation of best practices; as well as
requirements relating to the IT Service management and covering the need for
having key staff properly trained about IT Service Management, committing to
continual improvement and having their Service Management System (SMS)
interfacing with the EGI Service Management System, especially for important
processes like the Change Management process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providers: Joining as a Provider of new services</title><link>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/new-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/providers/getting-started/joining-eosc/new-services/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Technology Providers develop or deliver technology and software for specific
user communities or customisation for specific requirements. In our case,
they maintain the middleware which the RCs install and that allows the users
to exploit the compute, storage, data, and cloud resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable no-inline-html -->
&lt;p>To assure production quality of the EGI Infrastructure, every middleware stack
(Compute, Storage, etc.) installed on and delivered by the RCs needs to fulfil
a number of requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this purpose &lt;a href="https://confluence.egi.eu/x/DCImBg">PROC19&lt;/a> was defined

&lt;li>Information System: evaluating if the new technology should publish
information in the Information System according to the
&lt;a href="http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.147.pdf">GLUE Schema&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitoring: the new technology should allow external monitoring. If particular
aspects of the technology need to be monitored, specific monitoring probes
should be provided by the TPs and deployed on the
&lt;a href="https://argo.egi.eu/">EGI Monitoring service&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support: the Support Unit where incidents and service requests will be
