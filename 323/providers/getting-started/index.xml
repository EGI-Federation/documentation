&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Operations Start Guide will help you start with EGI Operations duties. It
covers the responsibilities of the various parties involved in the running of
the &lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/EGI+Infrastructure">EGI infrastructure&lt;/a> and
guide how to join operations. As a newcomer, you need to understand the
structure of the infrastructure and roles of operators at different levels.
Reading the whole document will give you a complete overall picture of daily
operations within EGI.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="resource-centres-and-resource-infrastructures">Resource Centres and Resource Infrastructures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Resources are geographically distributed and are contributed by
&lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Resource+Centre">Resource Centres&lt;/a>. A Resource
Centre is the smallest resource administration domain within EGI. It can be
either localized or geographically distributed. A Resource Centre is also known
as a &lt;em>site&lt;/em>. It provides a minimum set of local or remote IT Services, such as
High Throughput Compute (HTC), Cloud Compute, Storage and Data Transfer,
compliant to well-defined IT Capabilities necessary to make resources accessible
to authorised users. Users can access the services using common interfaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A
&lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Resource+Infrastructure">Resource Infrastructure&lt;/a>
federates one or more Resource Centres to constitute a homogeneous operational
domain, and the
&lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Resource+Infrastructure+Provider">Resource Infrastructure Provider&lt;/a>
is the legal organisation that is responsible of establishing, managing and of
operating directly or indirectly the operational services to an agreed level of
quality needed by the Resource Centres and the user community. It holds the
responsibility of integrating them in EGI to enable uniform resource access and
sharing for the benefit of their consuming end-users. Examples of a Resource
infrastructure Provider are the
&lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/European+Intergovernmental+Research+Organisation">European Intergovernmental Research Organisations (EIRO)&lt;/a>
and the &lt;a href="https://ims.egi.eu/display/EGIG/NGI">NGIs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Europe, Resource Centres are required to be affiliated to the respective
NGIs, which (a) have a mandate to represent their national users community in
all matters falling within the scope of the EGI Infrastructure, and (b) are the
only organization having the mandate described in (a) for its country and thus
provide a single contact point at the national level.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="roles">Roles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following sections covers the roles that are commonly involved in the
operations of the EGI Infrastructure. The correspondent
&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB/Input_System_User_Documentation#Roles">roles defined in Configuration Database (GOCDB)&lt;/a>
give specific rights in the Configuration Database itself and in other EGI
services. Other terms and definitions can be found in the
&lt;a href="https://go.egi.eu/glossary">EGI Glossary&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="resource-centre-level">Resource Centre level&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="resource-centre-administrator">Resource Centre Administrator&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>An individual responsible for installing, operating, maintaining and supporting
one or more Resources or IT Services in a Resource Centre. In the scope of
Operations, Resource Centres (RC) administrators primarily receive and react on
incidents at their Resource Centre and on service requests notified through
tickets created on the &lt;a href="../../../internal/helpdesk">EGI Helpdesk service&lt;/a>. They
should respond to the tickets in a suitable time frame as defined in the
&lt;a href="https://documents.egi.eu/document/31">Resource Centre Operational Level Agreement (OLA)&lt;/a>
and be aware of the alarms at their site, eg. through the
&lt;a href="https://operations-portal.egi.eu">Operations Dashboard&lt;/a>. Sites must only
operate supported middleware versions. This implies upgrading it regularly.
Emergency releases are treated in a special way. Resource Centre Administrators
must react to security issues that are at a global level, but affect their site.

specified time lines. They also provide support to Resource Centres and Virtual
Organisations (VOs) and provide support to oversight bodies in cases of
unresponsive Resource Centres. They ensure that all the necessary information is
available to all parties. The team is provided by each NGI and requires
procedural knowledge on the process (rather than technical skills) for their
work. New ROD team members are required to read the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Regional_Operator_on_Duty_welcome">ROD Welcome page&lt;/a>

&lt;li>addressing problems with Site availability or reliability. The reports are
issued on a monthly basis and the NGI operations managers have 10 days to
respond to identified problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>attending regular
&lt;a href="https://indico.egi.eu/category/19/">Operations Management Board meetings&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="joining-operations">Joining operations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to join any of the organisational groups in your NGI, you will need to
go through the following steps in order:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="authentication">Authentication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The authentication in EGI infrastructure works either with X509 personal
certificates or through federated identities using &lt;a href="../../check-in">Check-in&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="obtaining-a-x509-personal-certificate">Obtaining a X509 personal certificate&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you do not already have a X509 personal certificate
&lt;a href="https://www.eugridpma.org/members/worldmap/">the EUGridPMA worlmap&lt;/a> provides a
map of all certification authorities according to the country (or NGI). Select
your country on the map to find out who is your local CA. Follow the procedure
of your local CA to request a certificate. When you have received your
certificate, install it into your web browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If case of setting up a new Resource Centre please request Host certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EUGridPMA provides
&lt;a href="https://www.eugridpma.org/your-identity/">a web page allowing to test your certificate&lt;/a>.
Please use this resource and contact your CA if your certificate does not work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="create-a-federated-identity-registration-in-egi-check-in">Create a federated identity: registration in EGI Check-in&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As soon as you try to access an EGI service with your federated identity, you
will be requested to register an account in EGI Check-in if not existing yet.
The &lt;a href="../../../users/check-in/signup/">Check-in sign up guide&lt;/a> explains how to
sign up for an EGI account. If you already own an account, you will be simply
asked to login through EGI Check-in.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is recommended to join the &lt;a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Dteam_vo">dteam VO&lt;/a> at
the &lt;a href="https://voms2.hellasgrid.gr:8443/voms/dteam/">dteam Registration&lt;/a> page. You
should request group membership for &lt;code>/dteam&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/dteam/YOUR_NGI&lt;/code>. The dteam
group manager will then be notified and review your application.&lt;/p>
